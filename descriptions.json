Other letters are official government documents that provide otherwise inaccessible details about the ancient economy and government administration. Moreover, letters were understood to be gifts that enriched the lives and status of recipients.

We begin by looking at how the evolution of language was tightly linked to the evolution of bipedalism in our Homo lineage. Students will gain an understanding of how language evolved in conjunction with human locomotion and will read recent research on human dispersals and how language diversified as people moved around the globe. After studying this picture of linguistic diversity, we then ask why it is that so many similarities remain between languages separated by great distances. What do these similarities, called language universals, reveal about human cognition? Turning subsequently to modern migrations, we interrogate what might be learned about the nature of globalization by looking at how people are using language today. If globalization is often described as the dissolution of the nation-state in favor of global forces like “the market” and transnational organizations, how might speech practices attest to the continued relevance of the local in the construction of human identity? Examples from many different contexts will be contrasted in order to better understand the varying outcomes that result when language communities come into contact (e.g., language shift/maintenance/endangerment, diglossia, dialect leveling, code-switching), and also the identity dynamics and power relations at hand in each of these situations.

Citizenship is typically thought of as state-granted universal membership in the national community with a guarantee of equality through civil, political, and social rights. However, citizenship is also a terrain of social struggle in which marginalized groups contest their exclusion. Historically, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and other non-Whites have been restricted from full and equal standing in the nation. The high growth-rate of Latino/as since the 1970s has further challenged the notion of liberal inclusion. The key issue of undocumented migration and controversies over ‘illegality’ further complicate the significance of Latino citizenship within the borders of the United States. This class will incorporate interdisciplinary scholarship, focusing on how Latino/as have claimed rights in the shadow of citizenship. We will draw from legal and political theory, feminist theory, and critical race theory, as well as ethnographies and case studies that surface how citizenship is enacted and embodied. By the end of the course, students will understand the origins of nation-state citizenship, the role that race, gender, class, and labor played in shaping the legal parameters of American citizenship. Students will also be able to analyze how globalization, migration, and U.S. foreign and economic policies have challenged and transformed citizenship. Finally, students will analyze the different ways that subaltern communities have redefined citizenship through in their daily lives.","source":"Pomona","credits":100,"instructors":["A.

Though the chronological borders of that period shift from region to region (i.e. Southern to Northern Europe), it is generally a given that the period of time it designates is now closed. But what if the Renaissance is best conceived, not as a historical period, but as a historical project? What if the task of the reader is to understand the Renaissance as what Hans-George Gadamer called an “unfinished event?” The Renaissance so conceived is an idea that we might revive, revise, or redirect. The scholarly mode that it solicits is participation. This course will harness the core insights and innovations of the English Renaissance in order to imagine alternatives to modernity, the present moment, and the imminent future. Topics may include: human, nonhuman, and quasi-human; utopia, dystopia, and worldmaking; the abundance of language; metamorphosis and transformation.

He is struck by the scene; he makes a note of it: “she walks at her own pace, unaware of the fact that her son’s rhythm is different.” A year later, the scene inspires the first of his final lecture courses, which he called “How to Live Together: Novelistic Simulations of Some Everyday Spaces.” At the heart of the course was Barthes’ concept of idiorrhythmy, a monastic term, the idea of “individual rhythms” that exist-nonetheless-in and with a sense of community. To explore this idea, he turned to literature. This course will do that also. We will take up Barthes’ notion of idiorrhythmy and expand it into broader interdisciplinary theories of the commons: “spaces, experiences, resources, memories, or forms of sharing and living.” How does literature, we will ask, offer us ways to think about common spaces and experiences, about individual rhythms and efforts (and their failure) to bring those rhythms into community? Literature is also a commons: we’ll consider literary form, aesthetics, and poetics even as we look to literary representation, to “content.” Our literary focus will be literature in Britain from roughly 1700-1900, the period in which the Enclosure Acts took enormous common swaths of land and privatized them, the period in which rampant colonial ambitions, rising industrial capitalism, and rapid urbanization altered permanently the global landscape of common spaces and resources. Our theoretical reading, however, will range far more broadly: work on the commons moves across economics, politics, ecology and biology, aesthetics, philosophy, sociology, and, of course, literary and cultural theory. Literary authors may include: Daniel Defoe, Oliver Goldsmith, Mary Shelley, Margaret Cavendish, Olaudah Equiano, Christina Rossetti, Mary Wollstonecraft, Percy Shelley, William Wordsworth, Charlotte Smith, John Ruskin, E.M.","source":"Pomona","credits":100,"instructors":["Jordan Kirk"],"offered":"Last offered spring 2019.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":""},{"title":"Asian American Poetry: 1960s to the Present","identifier":"ENGL146PO","description":"This course will focus on canonical and non-canonical Asian American poetry; particularly, how that body of work has been read, regarded, and taught, as well how it has been included or excluded more generally in American Studies.

Bourgeois, every day, dour, realistic. Filled with very-long novels about banks and dinners. And then at the window, Frankenstein’s creature; a spectral woman in the garden; a hyena with human hands; a revenant nun; a malevolent vampire. This course examines the simmering undercurrents of fear in Victorian Britain through the supernatural beings populating its novels, poetry, short stories, and non-fiction prose. We will ask three questions: first, what is 19th-century Britain-powerful, wealthy, imperial-so afraid of, and why do those fears (of colonial uprising, of modern science, of women’s rights, of working-class insurrection, of sexual desire) take shape in literature as reanimated corpses, vampires, specters, immortal libertines, and human-animal hybrids? Second, how do the ascendant literary forms of this era try to manage that fear or, conversely, what literary innovations emerge from the failure to manage it? And finally, we will ask about the changing nature of fear itself in nineteenth-century Britain, from the cathartic fear that complements Romantic sublimity through the disciplinary fear imposed by institutional capitalism to the hysteria, anxiety, and neurosis of late century psychoanalytic thinking.","source":"Pomona","credits":100,"instructors":["Skyler Reidy"],"offered":"Last offered spring 2017.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":""},{"title":"James Joyce","identifier":"ENGL161PO","description":"Examinations of Joyce’s works: Dubliners, Portrait of the Artist, Exiles and Ulysses.

What can art tell us about the social sciences? Ralph Ellison worried that sociology would reduce songs, jokes, and stories to culture, and reduce persons to data; his friend Albert Murray simply called sociology ‘the folklore of white supremacy.’ Hannah Arendt assigned artworks the important task of maintaining a space between individual persons to prevent their collapse into a mass of social stuff. Jane Jacobs believed that economists and city planners fundamentally misunderstood the aesthetic nature of markets and cities. George Kubler proposed to reassign the entire category of artifacts, ‘desirable things’ that humans make, from cultural anthropology to art history. These five twentieth-century American writers tried to redefine the concept of culture so as to make it useful for art and artists. The goal, in Kubler’s words, was to create a kind of renaissance, a ‘type of society in which excellent art inevitably and necessarily appears.’ Perhaps they lost that argument; the successes of sociological approaches to literature suggest that they did. In this seminar, we will run the test again. We will also consider some examples of social theory by Du Bois, Moynihan, Elster, Fields, and Patterson; some songs, jokes, and stories; and selections from Vico and Tocqueville, two earlier writers who would have loved the social sciences. .","source":"Pomona","credits":100,"instructors":["Rose M.

By examining how race, identity, and place operate in the US and Brazil, we can better understand the social processes that create disparities in health. Further, focusing on informal settlements, places that are thought to embody these disparities (areas often referred to as slums, shantytown, favelas), helps to highlight these complex interrelated themes of place, health and identity. This course is designed to provide a broad investigation of urban health equity while focusing on the key role that identity formation and place-making have in both creating health disparities and community responses to ameliorate those disparities. In this course, students will engage with theoretical and practical tools that serve to unmask local and global health disparities.

Students will examine the formation of Asian American genders and sexualities alongside histories of racialization, migration, and labor that span East, South, and Southeast Asian, as well as Pacific contexts. In our engagement with transpacific movements of people and culture, we will foreground settler colonial occupations of the Pacific Islands and highlight the work of decolonial queer-feminist thinkers like Haunani-Kay Trask, Maile Arvin, and Stephanie Nohelani Teves. We will attend to the incommensurability of migrant and indigenous frameworks, even as we move through the persistence and at times concurrence of multiple forms of colonialism that connect Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. Some questions we will address include: How do historical contexts (i.e. the Cold War, 9/11, Japanese internment) affect Asian American gender formations?

Since the 1990s, however, more and more of these states have displayed significant weaknesses and fragility. While they retain formal control over people and territories, many face increased competition from alternative modes of social and political organizations, including “traditional” political systems, non-governmental organizations, religion-based groups, insurgencies and militias, decentralized entities, trafficking networks and internationally-sponsored trusteeship-like arrangements like quasi-permanent UN interventions. Scholars have tried to capture this increased institutional diversity with notions such as “hybrid effective governance,” “heterarchy,” “areas of limited statehood,” “oligopolies of violence,” and the like, calling attention to ongoing processes reminiscent of the birth of the nation state in competition with other forms of organization in late medieval Europe, for example. Relying on international-relations and comparative-politics literature, this class surveys the rapidly expanding scholarship on the topic, questions the future of the nation-state, and discusses policy implications for the international community.

Dante's condemnation of gluttony, Collodi's insatiable hungry Pinocchio, Pasolini's La Ricotta, and Ferzan Ozpetek's cinematic obsession with desserts, reveal how food can be a lens through which one can interpret Italy's sociopolitical, religious, and cultural panorama, how it has become a crucial element in defining \"Italianess\", and how its diversity reflects Italian identity whose dynamic and liquid nature is constantly shaped by its location as a Mediterranean crossroads.

Dante's condemnation of gluttony, Collodi's insatiable hungry Pinocchio, Pasolini's La Ricotta, and Ferzan Ozpetek's cinematic obsession with desserts, reveal how food can be a lens through which one can interpret Italy's sociopolitical, religious, and cultural panorama, how it has become a crucial element in defining \"Italianess\", and how its diversity reflects Italian identity whose dynamic and liquid nature is constantly shaped by its location as a Mediterranean crossroads.

The course is also concerned to understand why the status quo of the present is at once so violently oppressive for Palestinians and yet something many Jewish Israelis and their state accept. We also look at the crucial role of the US in maintaining, funding, and arming the status quo - and how that may be changing. In the final section of the course, we identify plausible futures for Palestine-Israel, and consider how a globally dispersed social justice movement can support the Palestinian struggle for equality and freedom - and thereby foster a positive or just peace for all persons in Palestine and Israel.","source":"Pitzer","credits":0,"instructors":[],"offered":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":""},{"title":"Gunpowder Empires: Ottomans, Safavids, and Mughals","identifier":"HIST100AKPO","description":"","source":"Pitzer","credits":0,"instructors":[],"offered":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":""},{"title":"Crusade and Jihad","identifier":"HIST100WXPO","description":"","source":"Pitzer","credits":0,"instructors":[],"offered":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":""},{"title":"Energy and Humanity: Past, Present and Future","identifier":"HIST112PZ","description":"This course starts by examining the energy regime of mobile-foraging, sedentary-farming, and industrial models of livelihood, as these modes of livelihood are found distributed across the earth and through human time, starting some 100,000 years ago.

Consequently, should America be a religious or secular nation? The extent to which we inhabit a Christian nation is one of the most ubiquitous (and shrill) debates in contemporary American politics. Central to this debate is the religious (or not-so religious) intentions behind our so-called Founding Fathers, and their plans for our nation’s religious establishment. For some, the Founders were pious and devout men intent on constructing an explicitly Christian nation; for others, they were borderline atheists who envisioned a strict separation of church and state. The historical reality is much more complex than either side readily admits. Burdened by anachronism and oversimplification, this debate is in dire need of thoughtful historical exploration from several angles. This is the work we will perform in this course. We will not only examine and contextualize the complex, conflicting, and often changing views of the Founders themselves, but we will also trace the evolution of this debate from the Revolution to the present.

We also look at the crucial role of the US in maintaining, funding, and arming the status quo - and how that may be changing. In the final section of the course, we identify plausible futures for Palestine-Israel, and consider how a globally dispersed social justice movement can support the Palestinian struggle for equality and freedom - and thereby foster a positive or just peace for all persons in Palestine and Israel.","source":"Pitzer","credits":0,"instructors":[],"offered":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":""},{"title":"Senior Seminar: Civil Disobedience","identifier":"POST198DPZ","description":"What is civic disobedience?

Yet, what do we mean by a good education? What literacy practices are privileged? And how do race, class, geography, and gender influence access? In this writing seminar, we investigate the cultural and communicative practices that define literacy in different educational settings. We begin by analyzing the literacy autobiographies of public intellectuals like Ta-Nehisi Coates and Mike Rose, before composing our own narratives about other people, perspectives, and institutions that have shaped our sense of ourselves as writers. Next, we draw on research from sociology, writing studies, and linguistics to reassess problematic representations of literacy in education policies and popular culture. For a capstone project, students write op-eds on an issue in education or literacy that interests them. Possible topics may include standardized tests and the college admissions process, language and identity, or the emergence of new literacies in the digital age.","source":"Pitzer","credits":0,"instructors":[],"offered":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":""},{"title":"The Writing Process","identifier":"WRIT016PZ","description":"An introductory course in composition designed to develop the reading, critical thinking, and writing strategies, including research and documentation skills, necessary for academic success.
