In a sense, as the literary theorist Catherine Gallagher has observed, novels helped create the modern idea of fictionality, acclimatizing readers for the first time to narratives that were plausible but not truthful. How, then, are we to understand recurrent attempts to produce a \'nonfiction novel\' in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries (clustering in the 1960s and 70s, the heyday of the New Journalism, and in the 2010s, the era of \'autofiction\')? Should this hybrid form be classified as a species of nonfiction journalism that borrows some of the formal techniques and cultural prestige of the novel, while continuing to be bound by the strictures and standards of factual reporting? Or do nonfiction novels lie closer to the heart of the novel\'s tradition, given the form\'s historical origins in a hazy gray area between reality and artifice, fiction and fact?

How can geology help us to trace the invention of tools, the development of complex trade routes, and even the invention of art? How did interactions with prehistoric beasts shape our world, inform our legends, and lead to the domestic plants and animals of today? And finally how have changing climates left their mark on both the rock record and archaeological record, driving the ascension and collapse of civilizations? Letter grade only.
