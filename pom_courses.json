A first unit looks at how the evolution of language was tightly linked to the evolution of bipedalism in our Homo lineage. Students will gain an understanding of how language evolved in conjunction with human locomotion and will read recent research on human dispersals and how language diversified as people moved around the globe. Differences and similarities between human language and non-human primate communication will also be explored in this first unit. After studying this picture of linguistic diversity, we then turn to examples of linguistic similarities, such as those between the creole languages spoken by descendants of enslaved peoples throughout the New World. The focus of this second unit is how the massive movements and domination involved in colonialism and slavery affected language communities, as well as the forms of linguistic and orthographic resistance that subjugated communities developed in response. A final unit interrogates what might be learned about the nature of globalization by looking at how people are using language today. If globalization is often described as the dissolution of the nation-state in favor of global forces like ?the market? and transnational organizations, how might speech practices attest to the continued relevance of the local in the construction of human identity? Examples from different contexts will be contrasted in order to better understand the varying outcomes that result when language communities come into contact through migration (e.g., language shift/maintenance/endangerment, diglossia, dialect leveling, code-switching), as well as the identity dynamics and power relations at hand in each of these situations. The course has a speaking-intensive overlay, and it culminates in the student presenting an oral piece (resembling a TED Talk) to their peers on a research topic of their choosing.

ANTH 101 is designed to familiarize the student with several distinct, but inter-related aspects of archaeological method and theory. Archaeology has developed its own history in relation to anthropology and needs to be contextualized within this background. The field has also developed its own distinct methods based on reconnaissance, excavation, and analysis. All archaeology is interpretive and reliant upon the methods utilized to collect data as well as upon the theoretical backgrounds, assumptions, and analyses that are applied. Archaeologists must also be concerned with a host of ethical questions that are of concern to field research in the present.

By examining how race, identity, and place operate in the US and Brazil, we can better understand the social processes that create disparities in health. Further, focusing on informal settlements, places that are thought to embody these disparities (areas often referred to as slums, shantytown, favelas), helps to highlight these complex interrelated themes of place, health and identity. This course is designed to provide a broad investigation of urban health equity while focusing on the key role that identity formation and place-making have in both creating health disparities and community responses to ameliorate those disparities. In this course, students will engage with theoretical and practical tools that serve to unmask local and global health disparities.

What has it been, and what could it be? The innermost form of the essay is heresy, writes Theodor Adorno. If the rest of literature is the visible spectrum, the essay, for Edward Said, is ultraviolet light. For Alfonso Reyes the essay contains the possibility of utopia; for Valeria Luiselli and Julietta Singh, it can contain the archive of all we repress or cannot tell. And for Cheryl Wall the essay is a fugitive genre, allowing those who are not free to write freedom. If essays have been compressed and standardized to five neat paragraphs in the U.S. educational system, elsewhere 'throughout history, and across the globe' they are expansive, resistant, creative, subversive. Most of all, they are experimental: they try things out. ('Essay,' from the French verb 'essai,' to try.) Essays are experiments, efforts to say what it is hardest to say, to create 'strange bridges' where there are none. This is a class in a literary form that tries to bridge public and private, world and self, what is and what might be, to bridge what has been suppressed by history and what nonetheless emerges, unbidden, as the resistant possibility that things can change. We will explore the essay in its many varieties and subgenres: the protest and the personal essay, the critical essay and the satirical one, the essay written to reveal and the one written to resist, the essay as it manifests in photography and film and on the internet.

Among his works are the first scientific treatise in English, an account of a meeting of birds he happened to overhear one day, a collection of life stories of important women, and a description of a journey to outer space he once took in a dream. But he is most famous for the long poem that we will read in this class. The Canterbury Tales is an interwoven collection of stories he had heard, read, or invented, some of which had come to him from as far away as India. He retells these stories, in a mode of extreme irony, through the mouths of a ragtag band of characters from all walks of life. Chaucer is the first great poet of the English language; he has an astonishingly filthy sense of humor; and his work points the way (perhaps) to a mystical knowledge of the true nature of reality.

We will also engage with theories such as evolutionary psychology, cultural anthropology, Marxist psychology, and critical theoryallowing us to compare and contrast various ways of studying human behavior. In order to aid us in this journey, we will ask questions such as: What role does human nature play in genocide? Can human nature be discovered by the scientific method? Is human nature today the same as it was 15,000 years ago? Or, could genocide have happened 15,000 years ago?","perm_count":55},{"course_code":"\"RLST113  HM-01\"","identifier":"RLST-113-HM-01","title":"God, Darwin, Design in America    ","description":"This course explores the relationship between scientific and religious ideas in the United States from the early nineteenth century to the present.

A first unit looks at how the evolution of language was tightly linked to the evolution of bipedalism in our Homo lineage. Students will gain an understanding of how language evolved in conjunction with human locomotion and will read recent research on human dispersals and how language diversified as people moved around the globe. Differences and similarities between human language and non-human primate communication will also be explored in this first unit. After studying this picture of linguistic diversity, we then turn to examples of linguistic similarities, such as those between the creole languages spoken by descendants of enslaved peoples throughout the New World. The focus of this second unit is how the massive movements and domination involved in colonialism and slavery affected language communities, as well as the forms of linguistic and orthographic resistance that subjugated communities developed in response. A final unit interrogates what might be learned about the nature of globalization by looking at how people are using language today. If globalization is often described as the dissolution of the nation-state in favor of global forces like ?the market? and transnational organizations, how might speech practices attest to the continued relevance of the local in the construction of human identity? Examples from different contexts will be contrasted in order to better understand the varying outcomes that result when language communities come into contact through migration (e.g., language shift/maintenance/endangerment, diglossia, dialect leveling, code-switching), as well as the identity dynamics and power relations at hand in each of these situations.

The films are entertainments, but they deal directly with political subjects; they imagine ways of being a patriot, an effective agent, a reliable civil servant, and of pursuing the interests of a state beyond lawful, acknowledged procedures.  We will emphasize interpretations that engage these concerns, and look to some essays by political philosophers to guide our analyses.   Students will write two papers of about 8 pages, and introduce one film to the class.  Their grades will be determined on the basis of (1) the quality of their writing, (2) the acuteness of their analyses, (3) and their class participation. Here are our films:\n \nNotorious (1946) \nNorth by Northwest (1959)\nManchurian Candidate (1962)\nSpy Who Came in from the Cold (1965)\nThree Days of the Condor (1975)\nTinker, Tailor (1979; 2011) \nMan on Fire (2004) \nLives of Others (2006)\nTraitor (2008) \nL'Affaire Farewell (2009)\nPage Eight [Worricker] (2011)\nHomeland (2011-19)\nA Most Wanted Man (2014) \n\nTHIS COURSE WILL BE ENTIRELY SYNCHRONOUS ON ZOOM.

We will explore such themes as wilderness vs. civilization; race relations; gender roles; and notions of American national identity. Students will engage in close study of about 10-12 films, and will read background materials in film criticism, American history, and the culture of the American west. Our main goal will be to achieve a deeper understanding of the Hollywood Western in and of itself and as a significant historical and political phenomenon.

He retells these stories, in a mode of extreme irony, through the mouths of a ragtag band of characters from all walks of life.

A first unit looks at how the evolution of language was tightly linked to the evolution of bipedalism in our Homo lineage. Students will gain an understanding of how language evolved in conjunction with human locomotion and will read recent research on human dispersals and how language diversified as people moved around the globe. Differences and similarities between human language and non-human primate communication will also be explored in this first unit. After studying this picture of linguistic diversity, we then turn to examples of linguistic similarities, such as those between the creole languages spoken by descendants of enslaved peoples throughout the New World. The focus of this second unit is how the massive movements and domination involved in colonialism and slavery affected language communities, as well as the forms of linguistic and orthographic resistance that subjugated communities developed in response. A final unit interrogates what might be learned about the nature of globalization by looking at how people are using language today. If globalization is often described as the dissolution of the nation-state in favor of global forces like ?the market? and transnational organizations, how might speech practices attest to the continued relevance of the local in the construction of human identity? Examples from different contexts will be contrasted in order to better understand the varying outcomes that result when language communities come into contact through migration (e.g., language shift/maintenance/endangerment, diglossia, dialect leveling, code-switching), as well as the identity dynamics and power relations at hand in each of these situations.

The course will exercise computing skills, especially for investigations beyond computing per se. Like Computer Science 5, this course uses Python as its implementation language. Unlike Computer Science 5, whose goal is mostly from-scratch coding, this course takes advantage of one of Python's particular strengths: its libraries.\n\nStudents learn and use a new library -- or two, or three, or four -- each week, building familiarity via a mix of specified and open-ended challenges. In the last part of the course, students will deploy and assess computing projects of their own design  with application beyond CS itself  as the courses final capstone. The course continues in the language of Computer Science 5 and especially encourages computing efforts which contribute to fields of interest beyond CS, whether academic or extracurricular.

What has it been, and what could it be? The innermost form of the essay is heresy, writes Theodor Adorno. If the rest of literature is the visible spectrum, the essay, for Edward Said, is ultraviolet light. For Alfonso Reyes the essay contains the possibility of utopia; for Valeria Luiselli and Julietta Singh, it can contain the archive of all we repress or cannot tell. And for Cheryl Wall the essay is a fugitive genre, allowing those who are not free to write freedom. If essays have been compressed and standardized to five neat paragraphs in the U.S. educational system, elsewhere 'throughout history, and across the globe' they are expansive, resistant, creative, subversive. Most of all, they are experimental: they try things out. ('Essay,' from the French verb 'essai,' to try.) Essays are experiments, efforts to say what it is hardest to say, to create 'strange bridges' where there are none. This is a class in a literary form that tries to bridge public and private, world and self, what is and what might be, to bridge what has been suppressed by history and what nonetheless emerges, unbidden, as the resistant possibility that things can change. We will explore the essay in its many varieties and subgenres: the protest and the personal essay, the critical essay and the satirical one, the essay written to reveal and the one written to resist, the essay as it manifests in photography and film and on the internet. We will read essays and theories of the essay from the form's origins in the sixteenth-century to its renaissance in the twenty-first, and from Argentina to France, from Hungary to Mexico, from Nigeria to the United States. And we will write, in different modes (creative and critical, verbal and visual, personal and dispassionate), in order to explore the essay's protean potential to the fullest.

A first unit looks at how the evolution of language was tightly linked to the evolution of bipedalism in our Homo lineage. Students will gain an understanding of how language evolved in conjunction with human locomotion and will read recent research on human dispersals and how language diversified as people moved around the globe. Differences and similarities between human language and non-human primate communication will also be explored in this first unit. After studying this picture of linguistic diversity, we then turn to examples of linguistic similarities, such as those between the creole languages spoken by descendants of enslaved peoples throughout the New World. The focus of this second unit is how the massive movements and domination involved in colonialism and slavery affected language communities, as well as the forms of linguistic and orthographic resistance that subjugated communities developed in response. A final unit interrogates what might be learned about the nature of globalization by looking at how people are using language today. If globalization is often described as the dissolution of the nation-state in favor of global forces like ?the market? and transnational organizations, how might speech practices attest to the continued relevance of the local in the construction of human identity? Examples from different contexts will be contrasted in order to better understand the varying outcomes that result when language communities come into contact through migration (e.g., language shift/maintenance/endangerment, diglossia, dialect leveling, code-switching), as well as the identity dynamics and power relations at hand in each of these situations. The course has a speaking-intensive overlay, and it culminates in the student presenting an oral piece (resembling a TED Talk) to their peers on a research topic of their choosing.

ANTH 101 is designed to familiarize the student with several distinct, but inter-related aspects of archaeological method and theory. Archaeology has developed its own history in relation to anthropology and needs to be contextualized within this background. The field has also developed its own distinct methods based on reconnaissance, excavation, and analysis. All archaeology is interpretive and reliant upon the methods utilized to collect data as well as upon the theoretical backgrounds, assumptions, and analyses that are applied. Archaeologists must also be concerned with a host of ethical questions that are of concern to field research in the present.

What has it been, and what could it be? The innermost form of the essay is heresy, writes Theodor Adorno. If the rest of literature is the visible spectrum, the essay, for Edward Said, is ultraviolet light. For Alfonso Reyes the essay contains the possibility of utopia; for Valeria Luiselli and Julietta Singh, it can contain the archive of all we repress or cannot tell. And for Cheryl Wall the essay is a fugitive genre, allowing those who are not free to write freedom. If essays have been compressed and standardized to five neat paragraphs in the U.S. educational system, elsewhere 'throughout history, and across the globe' they are expansive, resistant, creative, subversive. Most of all, they are experimental: they try things out. ('Essay,' from the French verb 'essai,' to try.) Essays are experiments, efforts to say what it is hardest to say, to create 'strange bridges' where there are none. This is a class in a literary form that tries to bridge public and private, world and self, what is and what might be, to bridge what has been suppressed by history and what nonetheless emerges, unbidden, as the resistant possibility that things can change. We will explore the essay in its many varieties and subgenres: the protest and the personal essay, the critical essay and the satirical one, the essay written to reveal and the one written to resist, the essay as it manifests in photography and film and on the internet. We will read essays and theories of the essay from the form's origins in the sixteenth-century to its renaissance in the twenty-first, and from Argentina to France, from Hungary to Mexico, from Nigeria to the United States. And we will write, in different modes (creative and critical, verbal and visual, personal and dispassionate), in order to explore the essay's protean potential to the fullest.

But he is most famous for the long poem that we will read in this class. The Canterbury Tales is an interwoven collection of stories he had heard, read, or invented, some of which had come to him from as far away as India. He retells these stories, in a mode of extreme irony, through the mouths of a ragtag band of characters from all walks of life.

Law is often understood to derive its legitimacy from its opposition to violence. And yet, paradoxically, the enforcement of law is inseparably bound to acts of state violence, both threatened and enacted. What role has law played in organized movements to suppress race-based violence? How have appeals to law supplied tools of recourse, resistance, political struggle, and freedom?

By drawing from readings in cultural studies, Black feminist theory, sociology, philosophy, and decolonial thought, the class explores questions surrounding the archive of transatlantic slavery and its afterlives. A crucial goal of the course is to engage critically the meaning of sexuality, intimacy, reproduction, labor, and domination in slaveholding societies. Throughout the course, students will discuss how the afterlives of slavery inform current ethical debates on issues like: sexual violence, reparations, surveillance, criminalization, incarceration, housing, militarism, imperialism, distribution of wealth, environmental racism, education, mental illness, political participation, and anti-colonial activism. The course is therefore structured less as a historical survey of slavery and more as an investigation as to how slavery is remembered and its rhetorical function when reasoning about today?s moral and political controversies. Special attention is paid to how a study of slavery?s afterlives challenges narratives of U.S. exceptionalism and innocence, as well as stories commonly told about freedom, emancipations, and racial progress.

Since the 1990s, however, more and more of these states have displayed significant weaknesses and fragility.  While they retain formal control over people and territories, many face increased competition from alternative modes of social and political organizations, including \"traditional\" political systems, non-governmental organizations, religion-based groups, insurgencies and militias, decentralized entities, trafficking networks and internationally-sponsored trusteeship-like arrangements like quasi-permanent UN interventions.  Scholars have tried to capture this increased institutional diversity with notions such as \"hybrid effective governance,\" \"heterarchy,\" \"areas of limited statehood,\" \"oligopolies of violence,\" and the like, calling attention to ongoing processes reminiscent of the birth of the nation state in competition with other forms of organization in late medieval Europe, for example.

You are to shock the \"student\" at increasing rates for every answer they get wrong. Eventually, you are required to shock them at a level capable of killing them. How far would you go? What factors are important in understanding how far you would go? Can evidence from such an experiment provide enough insight into why you may, or may not, be capable of committing acts of genocide? The course goal is to critically analyze experimental social psychology by applying it to the study of human nature and genocide. We will do this by studying classical social psychology paradigms and experiments. We will also engage with theories such as evolutionary psychology, cultural anthropology, Marxist psychology, and critical theoryallowing us to compare and contrast various ways of studying human behavior. In order to aid us in this journey, we will ask questions such as: What role does human nature play in genocide? Can human nature be discovered by the scientific method? Is human nature today the same as it was 15,000 years ago? Or, could genocide have happened 15,000 years ago?","perm_count":55},{"course_code":"\"PSYC180  CM-01\"","identifier":"PSYC-180-CM-01","title":"Forensic Psychology    ","description":"Examines the interaction of clinical psychology and law.

The topic for Spring 202 is:\n\nPolitics and Literature: The Case of George Orwell\n\nCourse description: George Orwell was the most influential and controversial political novelist and essayist of the last hundred years. No one was better at telling people what they didn't want to hear and doing it in lucid, unforgettable prose. Orwell devoted his life to learning about and explaining important things-how to write, how to think, how to live, what to love, and what to fear. He wrote about colonialism, war, poverty, and oppression from a personal point of view. He was a convinced Socialist but a bitter critic of the Left, an internationalist but a patriot, a freedom fighter but a loner and lover of nature, an intellectual who spent his life exposing the foibles of intellectuals. We will follow the phases of Orwell's thought and experience though his own writings-from his school days to his time in Burma, his fight against fascism in Spain, his intellectual encounters with the different forms of totalitarianism, and his novelistic debate with Aldous Huxley over the future threat to freedom. \n","perm_count":8},{"course_code":"\"LIT 107  CM-01\"","identifier":"LIT-107-CM-01","title":"African American Poetry    ","description":"Through reading, writing, and discussion, this course will introduce students to some of the most influential literary and vernacular poetry emerging from the African American cultural context.

A final unit interrogates what might be learned about the nature of globalization by looking at how people are using language today. If globalization is often described as the dissolution of the nation-state in favor of global forces like ?the market? and transnational organizations, how might speech practices attest to the continued relevance of the local in the construction of human identity? Examples from different contexts will be contrasted in order to better understand the varying outcomes that result when language communities come into contact through migration (e.g., language shift/maintenance/endangerment, diglossia, dialect leveling, code-switching), as well as the identity dynamics and power relations at hand in each of these situations. The course has a speaking-intensive overlay, and it culminates in the student presenting an oral piece (resembling a TED Talk) to their peers on a research topic of their choosing.

The subfield has developed its own extensive claims to a body of method and theory for dealing with the material remains of past human societies. ANTH 101 is designed to familiarize the student with several distinct, but inter-related aspects of archaeological method and theory. Archaeology has developed its own history in relation to anthropology and needs to be contextualized within this background. The field has also developed its own distinct methods based on reconnaissance, excavation, and analysis. All archaeology is interpretive and reliant upon the methods utilized to collect data as well as upon the theoretical backgrounds, assumptions, and analyses that are applied. Archaeologists must also be concerned with a host of ethical questions that are of concern to field research in the present. This course hopes to provide a background to understanding the uses of archaeological theory by specifically emphasizing the ways in which material culture can be utilized to make interpretations concerning both past and present behavior.

These two processes were often linked. Colonial aims influenced medico-scientific paradigms, and emergent scientific knowledge shaped how colonizers governed and controlled populations. This course examines these intertwined historical processes and how they laid the foundations for medico-scientific research and practice today. Drawing on anthropological and historical texts, we examine key themes such as scientific racism, hygiene and morality, and the regulation of indigenous knowledges.

Since the 1990s, however, more and more of these states have displayed significant weaknesses and fragility.  While they retain formal control over people and territories, many face increased competition from alternative modes of social and political organizations, including \"traditional\" political systems, non-governmental organizations, religion-based groups, insurgencies and militias, decentralized entities, trafficking networks and internationally-sponsored trusteeship-like arrangements like quasi-permanent UN interventions.  Scholars have tried to capture this increased institutional diversity with notions such as \"hybrid effective governance,\" \"heterarchy,\" \"areas of limited statehood,\" \"oligopolies of violence,\" and the like, calling attention to ongoing processes reminiscent of the birth of the nation state in competition with other forms of organization in late medieval Europe, for example.

Beginning in the eighteenth century, as major scientific developments were unfolding in Europe and the United States, these regions were engaging in colonial expansion in Africa, Asia and the Americas. These two processes were often linked. Colonial aims influenced medico-scientific paradigms, and emergent scientific knowledge shaped how colonizers governed and controlled populations. This course examines these intertwined historical processes and how they laid the foundations for medico-scientific research and practice today. Drawing on anthropological and historical texts, we examine key themes such as scientific racism, hygiene and morality, and the regulation of indigenous knowledges. Throughout, we engage with concepts of the postcolonial and the settler colonial to help us understand the complexity of connections between past and present.
