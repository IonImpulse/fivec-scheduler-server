What do we do when dominant powers insist on a version of truth that we do not believe? Is there such a thing as truth, and, if not, what does it mean for something to be a lie?

Students will learn how to speak in simple sentences about self, family, and friends with speakers of Arabic. It also aims to promote confidence to ask, and answer questions with ease, and to effectively communicate their ideas using the Arabic language with ease. The course will enable the students to articulate numerals, days of the week, months of the year, to tell time, and to understand and make simple commands easily and fluently. Non-credit.

In class, we’ll look beyond basic elements of craft and address issues of concern for the experienced writer. How do we avoid cliché? Create narrative drive? Take risks with form, language, and subject matter?
