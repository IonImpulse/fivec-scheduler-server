College also represents some of our greatest challenges. As individuals, we may face anxiety, self-doubt, and isolation. As a community, diverse life experiences, socioeconomic backgrounds, and beliefs may clash, with no easy solutions. We are challenged when our aspirations are unmet and our imaginations unrealized. How can colleges craft responses to foster the promise of higher education–from opportunity and social mobility to inclusion and pluralism? What more can and should be done? Through course materials, in conjunction with our own experiences and analysis, we will situate the institution of higher education within the broader context of American society, politics, and the economy. As part of our collective journey this semester, we will practice a variety of learning modalities, including student-driven discussion, informal in-class writing, formal (out-of-class) writing, and group projects. Throughout, we will practice knowledge construction as a communal process rooted in open dialog, thoughtful analysis, intellectual curiosity, and self-reflection.

This class explores that problem and controversy through the writings of the nation’s most influential black intellectuals. They include liberals, conservatives, and many iconoclasts who are not easily placed on any political spectrum. As these differences suggest, disagreements among our nation’s most prominent African American intellectuals run deep. They disagree, for example, over such fundamental questions as the significance of racism in modern America and the best means of achieving racial equality. Their varied perspectives have enriched and shaped our national conversation about race, and they continue to help all of us think more deeply about racial inequality-America’s most enduring social and political problem.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":"","perm_count":0,"fee":0},{"identifier":"PE-055A-PO-01","id":"055A","code":"PE","dept":"PO","section":"01","title":"Fencing I","max_seats":20,"seats_taken":15,"seats_remaining":5,"credits":25,"credits_hmc":75,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"start_time":"14:45:00","end_time":"15:35:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Smith Campus Center","room":"BLRM"}}],"instructors":["Paul C.

It examines why governments seem to abuse natural resources willfully, what forms of privatization hold promise for better resource use, what fiscal and governance arrangements are optimal for the relationship between government and state natural-resource agencies, and whether resource abundance is actually a “curse” rather than an advantage for a country’s economic and political development.

Through manuscripts, films, political speeches, novels, and visual art, we’ll study the voices and experiences of women in Spanish history. We consider women´s lives in the “Three Spains” (Al-Andalus, Hispania, and Sepharad); Medieval beguines and witches; Goya’s nineteenth-century depictions of women at war; and the Civil War anti-fascist group “Las trece rosas” - as well as individuals such as Queens Isabel and Sofía, the legendary lieutenant Catalina de Erauso, politician Clara Campoamor, painter Remedios Varo, and filmmaker Icíar Bollaín, among others. This course will be taught in Spanish.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":"","perm_count":0,"fee":0},{"identifier":"PE-155-JP-01","id":"155","code":"PE","dept":"JP","section":"01","title":"Track & Field-Men/Women","max_seats":150,"seats_taken":78,"seats_remaining":72,"credits":0,"credits_hmc":0,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["NA"],"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":"00:00:00","location":{"school":"ClaremontMckenna","building":"CMC PE Facilities","room":"ZIN"}}],"instructors":["Glenn A.

What role has law played in organized movements to suppress race-based violence? How have appeals to law supplied tools of recourse, resistance, political struggle, and freedom? Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law?

Since the 1990s, however, more and more of these states have displayed significant weaknesses and fragility. While they retain formal control over people and territories, many face increased competition from alternative modes of social and political organizations, including “traditional” political systems, non-governmental organizations, religion-based groups, insurgencies and militias, decentralized entities, trafficking networks and internationally-sponsored trusteeship-like arrangements like quasi-permanent UN interventions. Scholars have tried to capture this increased institutional diversity with notions such as “hybrid effective governance,” “heterarchy,” “areas of limited statehood,” “oligopolies of violence,” and the like, calling attention to ongoing processes reminiscent of the birth of the nation state in competition with other forms of organization in late medieval Europe, for example. Relying on international-relations and comparative-politics literature, this class surveys the rapidly expanding scholarship on the topic, questions the future of the nation-state, and discusses policy implications for the international community.

One of the most important factors shaping the size and composition of authorized and unauthorized immigration is U.S. immigration policy. Indeed, to meet labor demands, U.S. immigration policy initially encouraged immigration from Mexico and other parts of the globe. Although labor demands continued, by the latter part of the 20th Century, some elites saw a political opportunity by constructing immigrants as a threat and the U.S. Mexico border as dangerous. A major focus of this course examines the process that has led to the criminalization of immigrants and the militarization of the U.S. Mexico border.","prerequisites":"1 Intro Soc/Behavioral","corequisites":"","offered":"","perm_count":54,"fee":0},{"identifier":"PSYC-133-SC-01","id":"133","code":"PSYC","dept":"SC","section":"01","title":"Positive Psychology","max_seats":14,"seats_taken":12,"seats_remaining":2,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Reopened","timing":[{"days":["Friday"],"start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"16:15:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Outdoor classroom","room":"02"}},{"days":["Friday"],"start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"16:15:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Humanities Building","room":"105"}}],"instructors":["Lahnna Catalino"],"notes":"","description":"Positive psychology is the scientific study of optimal human functioning.

Some of the topics that will be discussed in the course include the nature of the self, the function of funerary rites, the geography of the afterlife, communication with the dead and religious notions of salvation/liberation. By exploring a variety of narratives and practices regarding death and the afterlife, students will develop a rich and detailed picture of the relationship between the living and the dead in the East Asian religious landscape.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":"","perm_count":1,"fee":0},{"identifier":"RLST-111-PO-01","id":"111","code":"RLST","dept":"PO","section":"01","title":"Theology, Morality and Policy","max_seats":20,"seats_taken":19,"seats_remaining":1,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"09:35:00","end_time":"10:50:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Pearsons Hall","room":"101"}}],"instructors":["Nikia Smith Robert"],"notes":"","description":"An examination of various issues in contemporary epistemology, metaphysics, and philosophy of mind.

Students will examine the formation of Asian American genders and sexualities alongside histories of racialization, migration, and labor that span East, South, and Southeast Asian, as well as Pacific contexts. In our engagement with transpacific movements of people and culture, we will foreground settler colonial occupations of the Pacific Islands and highlight the work of decolonial queer-feminist thinkers like Haunani-Kay Trask, Maile Arvin, and Stephanie Nohelani Teves. We will attend to the incommensurability of migrant and indigenous frameworks, even as we move through the persistence and at times concurrence of multiple forms of colonialism that connect Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. Some questions we will address include: How do historical contexts (i.e. the Cold War, 9/11, Japanese internment) affect Asian American gender formations? What does the popular (Orientalist depictions of Asian women from Geisha Girl to Tiger Mom) have to do with the geo-political (U.S. economic relations with Asia)? How might an Asian American queer politics reveal the limitations of the model minority myth? How can centering Pacific Islander onto-epistemologies decolonize notions of gender and sexuality?","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":"","perm_count":7,"fee":0},{"identifier":"SPAN-191-PO-04","id":"191","code":"SPAN","dept":"PO","section":"04","title":"Senior Thesis","max_seats":15,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":15,"credits":50,"credits_hmc":150,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["NA"],"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":"00:00:00","location":{"school":"NA","building":"","room":""}}],"instructors":["Jose Reynaldo Cartagena"],"notes":"By PERM only","description":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":"","perm_count":0,"fee":0},{"identifier":"SPAN-191-PO-08","id":"191","code":"SPAN","dept":"PO","section":"08","title":"Senior Thesis","max_seats":15,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":15,"credits":50,"credits_hmc":150,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["NA"],"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":"00:00:00","location":{"school":"NA","building":"","room":""}}],"instructors":["Suzanne Chavez Silverman"],"notes":"By PERM only","description":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":"","perm_count":0,"fee":0},{"identifier":"SPAN-191-SC-01","id":"191","code":"SPAN","dept":"SC","section":"01","title":"Senior Thesis in Spanish","max_seats":99,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":99,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["NA"],"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":"00:00:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Arranged Location","room":""}}],"instructors":["Staff"],"notes":"Non-SC need permission.
