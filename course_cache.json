Causes and consequences of variations across time, space and subgroups in fertility, mortality, family structure, human capital investment, labor force involvement and migration will be considered, as will impacts on populations and subgroups of natural disasters, wars, pandemics, macroeconomic events, government policies, technology change, and changes in human longevity.  Demographic and economic data for a wide variety of countries are used to demonstrate the interaction between economic and demographic change at the macro level.  We will analyze implications for public pension systems, health systems, economic growth, the environment, inter-group conflict, and government budgets.  Basic techniques of demographic measurement and mathematical demography are covered, with emphasis on hands-on analysis and presentation of demographic and economic data. Letter grade only.

In a sense, as the literary theorist Catherine Gallagher has observed, novels helped create the modern idea of fictionality, acclimatizing readers for the first time to narratives that were plausible but not truthful. How, then, are we to understand recurrent attempts to produce a &#8216;nonfiction novel&#8217; in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries (clustering in the 1960s and 70s, the heyday of the New Journalism, and in the 2010s, the era of &#8216;autofiction&#8217;)? Should this hybrid form be classified as a species of nonfiction journalism that borrows some of the formal techniques and cultural prestige of the novel, while continuing to be bound by the strictures and standards of factual reporting? Or do nonfiction novels lie closer to the heart of the novel&#8217;s tradition, given the form&#8217;s historical origins in a hazy gray area between reality and artifice, fiction and fact?

How is work socially and spatially organized? How are these forms of spatial organization struggled over and transformed? Who performs what kind of work? Where? Why? This course introduces students to some of the leading critical approaches to the geographies of labor, including Marxist political economy and feminist, critical-race, anticolonial and queer theories. This course investigates a number of contemporary shifts in the organization of work, including the rise of neoliberalism, deindustrialization, the feminization of the paid labor force, the prevalence of precarious work, contemporary forms of labor migration, and the expansion of prison labor. Locating these shifts in the longer histories and geographies of unfree labor, students will examine some of the ways in which workers have used their labor as a departure point for collective action, including unionization, work refusals, and struggles over social reproduction."},{"identifier":"GEOG-179G-HM-01","id":"179G","code":"GEOG","dept":"HM","section":"01","title":"Political Ecologies","max_seats":24,"seats_taken":23,"seats_remaining":1,"credits":0,"status":"Reopened","timing":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"14:55:00","end_time":"16:10:00","location":{"school":"HarveyMudd","building":"Shanahan Center","room":"2465"}}],"instructors":[" David Seitz"],"notes":"","description":""},{"identifier":"GEOL-015-PO-01","id":"015","code":"GEOL","dept":"PO","section":"01","title":"SoCal Earthquakes and Water","max_seats":12,"seats_taken":13,"seats_remaining":-1,"credits":0,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"09:35:00","end_time":"10:50:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Edmunds","room":"130"}},{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"09:35:00","end_time":"10:50:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Studio Arts","room":"OUTD"}}],"instructors":[" Linda A.

In this course we will concentrate on the Stone Age through the Bronze Age, looking at how we became a species, how our species spread across the globe, and how events like the domestication of plants and animals to climate change shaped ancient people&#8217;s lives. How can geology help us to trace the invention of tools, the development of complex trade routes, and even the invention of art? How did interactions with prehistoric beasts shape our world, inform our legends, and lead to the domestic plants and animals of today? And finally how have changing climates left their mark on both the rock record and archaeological record, driving the ascension and collapse of civilizations? Letter grade only.

It employs the policy sciences framework to explore the political and economic-policy challenges of minimizing the abuse of resource endowments due to mis-pricing, corruption, intra-governmental conflicts, and perverse governance arrangements. It examines why governments seem to abuse natural resources willfully, what forms of privatization hold promise for better resource use, what fiscal and governance arrangements are optimal for the relationship between government and state natural-resource agencies, and whether resource abundance is actually a &#8220;curse&#8221; rather than an advantage for a country&#8217;s economic and political development. The cases will be drawn predominantly from Africa, Asia, and Latin America.

Over the course of the semester, we will examine four different answers to that question. We will ask how has the definition of specific Asian cuisines shaped their relationship to the environment? Then we will turn to the creators of cuisines—chefs—and ask how have their culinary decisions affected the environment? The third section will consider the way restaurants market themselves and ask what do their representations reveal about their relationships with the environment. And the last section will focus on the important farm-to-table movement and ask how, if at all, has it changed prevailing views of food and the environment? Letter grade only.

Why have we not made more significant progress and what will it take to do so?  In this course, we will use critical theories (including critical race theory, feminism, Marxism, and others) to understand the entangled issues behind this and other persistent inequities. The purpose of this course is to help fulfill the HMC mission statement more completely by empowering students to be engaged, critical, and civic-minded participants who can positively impact society. This class will have a reasonable out-of-class homework requirement that will be commensurate with a one-unit

We will use scholarship, media, and case studies from across the African continent and world to explore topics such as: environment and health; the built environment and cities; energy; extractive industries; commodity chains; food systems and agriculture; soil and land; waste management; environmental degradation; capitalism and environmental violence; post-humanism, indigeneity, and resource use; transnational environmental governance; conservation; climate change and climate (in)justice; environmental imagery, imagination, and political economy; and environmental futures. In so doing, we ask: in a globalized world, how do gender, race, ethnicity, class, and colonialist legacies influence the questions raised and the solutions offered in response to African environmental issues?
