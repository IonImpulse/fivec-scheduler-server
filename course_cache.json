We begin by looking at how the evolution of language was tightly linked to the evolution of bipedalism in our Homo lineage. Students will gain an understanding of how language evolved in conjunction with human locomotion and will read recent research on human dispersals and how language diversified as people moved around the globe. After studying this picture of linguistic diversity, we then ask why it is that so many similarities remain between languages separated by great distances. What do these similarities, called language universals, reveal about human cognition? Turning subsequently to modern migrations, we interrogate what might be learned about the nature of globalization by looking at how people are using language today. If globalization is often described as the dissolution of the nation-state in favor of global forces like “the market” and transnational organizations, how might speech practices attest to the continued relevance of the local in the construction of human identity? Examples from many different contexts will be contrasted in order to better understand the varying outcomes that result when language communities come into contact (e.g., language shift/maintenance/endangerment, diglossia, dialect leveling, code-switching), and also the identity dynamics and power relations at hand in each of these situations.

The subfield has developed its own extensive claims to a body of method and theory for dealing with the material remains of past human societies. ANTH 101 is designed to familiarize the student with several distinct, but inter-related aspects of archaeological method and theory. Archaeology has developed its own history in relation to anthropology and needs to be contextualized within this background. The field has also developed its own distinct methods based on reconnaissance, excavation, and analysis. All archaeology is interpretive and reliant upon the methods utilized to collect data as well as upon the theoretical backgrounds, assumptions, and analyses that are applied. Archaeologists must also be concerned with a host of ethical questions that are of concern to field research in the present. This course hopes to provide a background to understanding the uses of archaeological theory by specifically emphasizing the ways in which material culture can be utilized to make interpretations concerning both past and present behavior.

New forms emerged such as modern and postmodern dance, butoh, styles of professional folk dancing that first developed in Eastern Europe and classical Asian traditions that had never been presented outside of the courts in which they had developed. In addition, the 19th century saw the beginnings of Broadway musicals, and the 20th century the development of dance for the movies, and later television, which dramatically increased the demand for dance performances. The course will look at the ways these various professional dance genres have developed and the role they play in the concert scene today.

A social activity such as a school dance or dancing in a club, 2. A form of entertainment as in a Broadway or Hollywood musical or a television program like “Dancing with the Stars,” or 3. A form of artistic production like Giselle or choreography by Martha Graham. In this class we will look at dance in a different way. We will look at dance as a vehicle for achieving political goals, for representing the state, for building ethnic identities, for demonstrating national pride. We will first conceptualize the idea of dance as a political vehicle and then we will look at specific examples: Irish step dancing, Ukrainian and Russian folk dancing, the Hawaiian hula, the Argentine tango and Turkish folk dancing, among others, all of which have served regimes of various political stripes.

Yet the social, political, and environmental processes that determine who gets to live where, and what the conditions are in those places provide insights into the drivers for global health disparities. By examining how race, identity, and place operate in the US and Brazil, we can better understand the social processes that create disparities in health. Further, focusing on informal settlements, places that are thought to embody these disparities (areas often referred to as slums, shantytown, favelas), helps to highlight these complex interrelated themes of place, health and identity. This course is designed to provide a broad investigation of urban health equity while focusing on the key role that identity formation and place-making have in both creating health disparities and community responses to ameliorate those disparities. In this course, students will engage with theoretical and practical tools that serve to unmask local and global health disparities.

Though the chronological borders of that period shift from region to region (i.e. Southern to Northern Europe), it is generally a given that the period of time it designates is now closed. But what if the Renaissance is best conceived, not as a historical period, but as a historical project? What if the task of the reader is to understand the Renaissance as what Hans-George Gadamer called an “unfinished event?” The Renaissance so conceived is an idea that we might revive, revise, or redirect. The scholarly mode that it solicits is participation. This course will harness the core insights and innovations of the English Renaissance in order to imagine alternatives to modernity, the present moment, and the imminent future. Topics may include: human, nonhuman, and quasi-human; utopia, dystopia, and worldmaking; the abundance of language; metamorphosis and transformation. Written work will draw largely on exercises of the Elizabethan schoolroom, including: commonplace books; imitations, emulations, and adaptations; exercises in impersonation; and two essays. We will focus on works by Renaissance poets including Francesco Petrarch, Edmund Spenser, and William Shakespeare but we will also reach backward to poets like Ovid, and forward to writers including Oscar Wilde, Franz Kafka, and Jorge Luis Borges.

What has it been, and what could it be? The innermost form of the essay is heresy, writes Theodor Adorno. If the rest of literature is the visible spectrum, the essay, for Edward Said, is ultraviolet light. For Alfonso Reyes the essay contains the possibility of utopia; for Valeria Luiselli and Julietta Singh, it can contain the archive of all we repress or cannot tell. And for Cheryl Wall the essay is a fugitive genre, allowing those who are not free to write freedom. If essays have been compressed and standardized to five neat paragraphs in the U.S. educational system, elsewhere ‘throughout history, and across the globe’ they are expansive, resistant, creative, subversive. Most of all, they are experimental: they try things out. (‘Essay,’ from the French verb ‘essai,’ to try.) Essays are experiments, efforts to say what it is hardest to say, to create ‘strange bridges’ where there are none. This is a class in a literary form that tries to bridge public and private, world and self, what is and what might be, to bridge what has been suppressed by history and what nonetheless emerges, unbidden, as the resistant possibility that things can change. We will explore the essay in its many varieties and subgenres: the protest and the personal essay, the critical essay and the satirical one, the essay written to reveal and the one written to resist, the essay as it manifests in photography and film and on the internet. We will read essays and theories of the essay from the form’s origins in the sixteenth-century to its renaissance in the twenty-first, and from Argentina to France, from Hungary to Mexico, from Nigeria to the United States. And we will write, in different modes (creative and critical, verbal and visual, personal and dispassionate), in order to explore the essay’s protean potential to the fullest.

Why did the forbidden but desired Other play such a starring role in literature after the Revolution? And why does romance play such an important role in Romanticism, the first great literary movement of post-revolutionary French society?

Do they each offer equally rational ways of comprehending the world? We will also investigate how deeply our nation is divided.

This course does not focus on syntactic theory, but instead introduces students to the wide range of grammatical structures that are possible in human language. The course includes overview readings and discussions of broadly attested morphosyntactic patterns. In addition, students will research an individual (unfamiliar) language over the course of a semester (based on existing research on the language) and will present the structures of their chosen language back to the class on a regular basis in both written and oral form. In this way the class serves to introduce students to the range of morphosyntactic constructions in a broad range of the world’s languages.

Third, the training in karate is used as a vehicle to inspire personal excellence and strives to cultivate one’s character by valuing such traits as courtesy, respect and humility.

Students will explore the work of artists who engaged with principles of geometric optics, such as Johannes Vermeer, Samuel van Hoogstraten, and Rembrandt van Rijn, and they will also recreate and use optical devices, such as the camera obscura and camera lucida. Students will also practice drawing techniques to represent objects in illusionistic perspective as well as perspectival manipulations such as anamorphosis. Course assessment will include written responses to works of art, lab exercises, and final projects incorporating studio art practice. Letter grade only.

Since the 1990s, however, more and more of these states have displayed significant weaknesses and fragility. While they retain formal control over people and territories, many face increased competition from alternative modes of social and political organizations, including “traditional” political systems, non-governmental organizations, religion-based groups, insurgencies and militias, decentralized entities, trafficking networks and internationally-sponsored trusteeship-like arrangements like quasi-permanent UN interventions. Scholars have tried to capture this increased institutional diversity with notions such as “hybrid effective governance,” “heterarchy,” “areas of limited statehood,” “oligopolies of violence,” and the like, calling attention to ongoing processes reminiscent of the birth of the nation state in competition with other forms of organization in late medieval Europe, for example. Relying on international-relations and comparative-politics literature, this class surveys the rapidly expanding scholarship on the topic, questions the future of the nation-state, and discusses policy implications for the international community.

Given that Brazil has such a vast territory, we will also focus on different regions and their contributions to the country’s cultural richness."},{"identifier":"PORT-022-PZ-01","id":"022","code":"PORT","dept":"PZ","section":"01","title":"Intensive Introductry Portuguese","max_seats":18,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":18,"credits":100,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday","Friday"],"start_time":"10:00:00","end_time":"10:50:00","location":{"school":"Pitzer","building":"To Be Assigned","room":""}}],"instructors":["Juanita Aristizabal"],"notes":"","description":""},{"identifier":"PORT-035-PZ-01","id":"035","code":"PORT","dept":"PZ","section":"01","title":"Portuguese Virtual Learning Comm","max_seats":15,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":15,"credits":50,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["NA"],"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":"00:00:00","location":{"school":"Pitzer","building":"To Be Assigned","room":""}}],"instructors":["Juanita Aristizabal"],"notes":"","description":""},{"identifier":"PORT-044-CM-01","id":"044","code":"PORT","dept":"CM","section":"01","title":"Advanced Portuguese","max_seats":18,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":18,"credits":100,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"start_time":"09:35:00","end_time":"10:50:00","location":{"school":"ClaremontMckenna","building":"The Kravis Center","room":"100"}}],"instructors":["Norman A.

To meet intellectual, social and political challenges that included state persecution.

We will also explore various descriptions of the terrain of the afterlife or postmortem world by critically engaging a variety of textual and visual records of China, Korea and Japan. Some of the topics that will be discussed in the course include the nature of the self, the function of funerary rites, the geography of the afterlife, communication with the dead and religious notions of salvation/liberation.

From the Cyclops of Homer’s Odyssey to its refiguring in D.W. Griffith’s “The Birth of a Nation,” the powers of the eye are equated with those of its celestial counterpart. This intrigue has been reshaped—but not lost—with the advent of modern visual surveillance techniques. In this course, we will examine a range of manifestations of the solar eye, paying particular attention to the relationship(s) it bears to reality and the ways in which the solar eye operates in schemes both great and small of confidence and illusion.

Yet research shows us writing is a social practice developed through regular practice, challenging new tasks, and constructive feedback. In this seminar we investigate theories from writing studies to examine our own diverse experiences in writing. What does it mean to call something “good” writing? What ideological and cultural assumptions underwrite definitions? What can scholars tell us about why so many of us struggle with the writing process? And what are some strategies we can use to help ourselves and others grow as writers?

Why should or shouldn't anyone pursue the liberal arts? Why is it so hard for colleges to decide which subjects are required? What is the value of a liberal-arts education in an increasingly commodified world? What is the definition and value of diversity in the liberal arts? Are new values threatening to overshadow basic pursuits into knowledge and truth, and is this good or bad? Our examination will translate into working together towards designing, developing, shaping, and polishing clear and detailed compositions.
