The primary aim of the course is to familiarize students with the linguistic anthropological approach to language, according to which language is a social tool with significance for sociopolitical processes, on the one hand, and basic research methods in linguistic anthropology, on the other. The course has two interwoven parts. The first is the sequence of readings, which will be analyzed in particular for the evidence and methods on which they draw. These readings trace the development of linguistic anthropology chronologically, beginning with the branching of linguistics into the fields of theoretical linguistics and linguistic anthropology, then examining early linguistic anthropologists’ inquiries into linguistic relativism and whether language shapes thought, before turning finally to contemporary semiotic approaches to language, illustrated through selected ethnographic examples. The second part of the course is a field practicum in which students will observe language in the social setting of their choice, produce field notes, and draft written analyses guided by questions that we will consider at length. Via their fieldwork students will become adept at using a range of methods for collecting data and analyzing how people use language, including participant observation, interviews, field notes, audio recordings, and discourse analytic transcriptions. The course also has a writing-intensive overlay; accordingly, throughout the semester students will write up a series of shorter ethnographic analyses that they will then revise and collate into an original research paper.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"ANTH-053-PO-01","id":"053","code":"ANTH","dept":"PO","section":"01","title":"Language and Globalization","max_seats":18,"seats_taken":20,"seats_remaining":-2,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:30:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Hahn Social Science Bldg","room":"107"}}],"instructors":["Cecile Traore"],"notes":"","description":"This course covers how language and human movement have been intertwined over time, from early human dispersals through modern migrations. We begin by looking at how the evolution of language was tightly linked to the evolution of bipedalism in our Homo lineage. Students will gain an understanding of how language evolved in conjunction with human locomotion and will read recent research on human dispersals and how language diversified as people moved around the globe. After studying this picture of linguistic diversity, we then ask why it is that so many similarities remain between languages separated by great distances. What do these similarities, called language universals, reveal about human cognition? Turning subsequently to modern migrations, we interrogate what might be learned about the nature of globalization by looking at how people are using language today. If globalization is often described as the dissolution of the nation-state in favor of global forces like “the market” and transnational organizations, how might speech practices attest to the continued relevance of the local in the construction of human identity? Examples from many different contexts will be contrasted in order to better understand the varying outcomes that result when language communities come into contact (e.g., language shift/maintenance/endangerment, diglossia, dialect leveling, code-switching), and also the identity dynamics and power relations at hand in each of these situations. The course has a speaking-intensive overlay and uses films alongside readings to explore each unit’s key topics.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"ANTH-100-PO-01","id":"100","code":"ANTH","dept":"PO","section":"01","title":"Anthropology of Sound","max_seats":20,"seats_taken":17,"seats_remaining":3,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"start_time":"14:45:00","end_time":"16:00:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Hahn Social Science Bldg","room":"214"}}],"instructors":["Alexandra Sharp Lippman"],"notes":"","description":"Technology from the wheel to the printing press has influenced identity, community and society throughout time.

Archaeology has developed its own history in relation to anthropology and needs to be contextualized within this background. The field has also developed its own distinct methods based on reconnaissance, excavation, and analysis. All archaeology is interpretive and reliant upon the methods utilized to collect data as well as upon the theoretical backgrounds, assumptions, and analyses that are applied. Archaeologists must also be concerned with a host of ethical questions that are of concern to field research in the present.

Beginning in the eighteenth century, as major scientific developments were unfolding in Europe and the United States, these regions were engaging in colonial expansion in Africa, Asia and the Americas. These two processes were often linked. Colonial aims influenced medico-scientific paradigms, and emergent scientific knowledge shaped how colonizers governed and controlled populations. This course examines these intertwined historical processes and how they laid the foundations for medico-scientific research and practice today. Drawing on anthropological and historical texts, we examine key themes such as scientific racism, hygiene and morality, and the regulation of indigenous knowledges. Throughout, we engage with concepts of the postcolonial and the settler colonial to help us understand the complexity of connections between past and present.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"ANTH-115-SC-01","id":"115","code":"ANTH","dept":"SC","section":"01","title":"Stuff:Social Life of Commodities","max_seats":10,"seats_taken":13,"seats_remaining":-3,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"14:45:00","end_time":"16:00:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Humanities Building","room":"104"}},{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"14:45:00","end_time":"16:00:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Outdoor classroom","room":"01"}}],"instructors":["SeoYoung Park"],"notes":"Instructor permission required.","description":"The world is becoming overstuffed by stuff.

In addition, the 19th century saw the beginnings of Broadway musicals, and the 20th century the development of dance for the movies, and later television, which dramatically increased the demand for dance performances.

A form of artistic production like Giselle or choreography by Martha Graham. In this class we will look at dance in a different way. We will look at dance as a vehicle for achieving political goals, for representing the state, for building ethnic identities, for demonstrating national pride. We will first conceptualize the idea of dance as a political vehicle and then we will look at specific examples: Irish step dancing, Ukrainian and Russian folk dancing, the Hawaiian hula, the Argentine tango and Turkish folk dancing, among others, all of which have served regimes of various political stripes.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"DANC-142-SC-01","id":"142","code":"DANC","dept":"SC","section":"01","title":"Feminist Ethnography & Perf","max_seats":20,"seats_taken":10,"seats_remaining":10,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"start_time":"16:30:00","end_time":"18:00:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Vita Nova Hall","room":"100"}}],"instructors":["Meiver De la Cruz"],"notes":"1st-yrs need permission.","description":"This course explores transnational feminist epistemologies alongside performance studies research methods.

Yet the social, political, and environmental processes that determine who gets to live where, and what the conditions are in those places provide insights into the drivers for global health disparities. By examining how race, identity, and place operate in the US and Brazil, we can better understand the social processes that create disparities in health. Further, focusing on informal settlements, places that are thought to embody these disparities (areas often referred to as slums, shantytown, favelas), helps to highlight these complex interrelated themes of place, health and identity. This course is designed to provide a broad investigation of urban health equity while focusing on the key role that identity formation and place-making have in both creating health disparities and community responses to ameliorate those disparities. In this course, students will engage with theoretical and practical tools that serve to unmask local and global health disparities.

If artists are not independent self-knowers, but rather products of socially constructed effects of power, to what extent do they have control over their work? If objective certainty is a myth, how do we judge good art from bad? If the cult of the ‘genius’ is a product of patriarchy, how do we conceive of creative expression?

Though the chronological borders of that period shift from region to region (i.e. Southern to Northern Europe), it is generally a given that the period of time it designates is now closed. But what if the Renaissance is best conceived, not as a historical period, but as a historical project? What if the task of the reader is to understand the Renaissance as what Hans-George Gadamer called an “unfinished event?” The Renaissance so conceived is an idea that we might revive, revise, or redirect. The scholarly mode that it solicits is participation. This course will harness the core insights and innovations of the English Renaissance in order to imagine alternatives to modernity, the present moment, and the imminent future. Topics may include: human, nonhuman, and quasi-human; utopia, dystopia, and worldmaking; the abundance of language; metamorphosis and transformation. Written work will draw largely on exercises of the Elizabethan schoolroom, including: commonplace books; imitations, emulations, and adaptations; exercises in impersonation; and two essays. We will focus on works by Renaissance poets including Francesco Petrarch, Edmund Spenser, and William Shakespeare but we will also reach backward to poets like Ovid, and forward to writers including Oscar Wilde, Franz Kafka, and Jorge Luis Borges.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"ENGL-099-PZ-01","id":"099","code":"ENGL","dept":"PZ","section":"01","title":"Desire & Love in Mod & Cont Lit","max_seats":16,"seats_taken":16,"seats_remaining":0,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Wednesday"],"start_time":"19:00:00","end_time":"21:50:00","location":{"school":"Pitzer","building":"Skandera Hall","room":"P103"}}],"instructors":["Jon-David W.

What has it been, and what could it be? The innermost form of the essay is heresy, writes Theodor Adorno. If the rest of literature is the visible spectrum, the essay, for Edward Said, is ultraviolet light. For Alfonso Reyes the essay contains the possibility of utopia; for Valeria Luiselli and Julietta Singh, it can contain the archive of all we repress or cannot tell. And for Cheryl Wall the essay is a fugitive genre, allowing those who are not free to write freedom. If essays have been compressed and standardized to five neat paragraphs in the U.S. educational system, elsewhere ‘throughout history, and across the globe’ they are expansive, resistant, creative, subversive. Most of all, they are experimental: they try things out. (‘Essay,’ from the French verb ‘essai,’ to try.) Essays are experiments, efforts to say what it is hardest to say, to create ‘strange bridges’ where there are none. This is a class in a literary form that tries to bridge public and private, world and self, what is and what might be, to bridge what has been suppressed by history and what nonetheless emerges, unbidden, as the resistant possibility that things can change. We will explore the essay in its many varieties and subgenres: the protest and the personal essay, the critical essay and the satirical one, the essay written to reveal and the one written to resist, the essay as it manifests in photography and film and on the internet. We will read essays and theories of the essay from the form’s origins in the sixteenth-century to its renaissance in the twenty-first, and from Argentina to France, from Hungary to Mexico, from Nigeria to the United States. And we will write, in different modes (creative and critical, verbal and visual, personal and dispassionate), in order to explore the essay’s protean potential to the fullest.

Even though early precursors like Guy-Blaché, were often erased from film history, women directors in France have a long tradition to draw from. It is this tradition of women filmmaking that we will explore in this course, focusing in particular on a new generation of women directors who today are revitalizing contemporary French cinema. Directors studied include: Guy, Dulac, Epstein, Varda, Akerman, Denis, Palcy, Sciamma, Maïwenn, Benguigui, Braillat, Ducournau.

These new generations are French citizens whose parents or grandparents were originally from North Africa or sub-Saharan Africa, yet who grew up or were born in France, often in the suburbs of major French cities. This course will focus on their experience and more broadly the experience of being African in France in the 21st Century, an experience rooted in migration and colonial history between France and the African continent. Specifically, however, we will also examine the place this new generation occupies in France today through close readings of selected literary and critical texts and through a range of media, old and new, aural and visual.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"FREN-160-SC-01","id":"160","code":"FREN","dept":"SC","section":"01","title":"Romancing the Revolution","max_seats":18,"seats_taken":13,"seats_remaining":5,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Reopened","timing":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"16:15:00","end_time":"17:30:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Balch Hall","room":"219"}}],"instructors":["France Lemoine"],"notes":"","description":"This class looks at the French Revolution through Victor Hugo's novel Quatre-Vingt-Treize and the lives and writings of outstanding women of the era.

And why does romance play such an important role in Romanticism, the first great literary movement of post-revolutionary French society?

What can art tell us about the social sciences? Ralph Ellison worried that sociology would reduce songs, jokes, and stories to culture, and reduce persons to data; his friend Albert Murray simply called sociology ‘the folklore of white supremacy.’ Hannah Arendt assigned artworks the important task of maintaining a space between individual persons to prevent their collapse into a mass of social stuff. Jane Jacobs believed that economists and city planners fundamentally misunderstood the aesthetic nature of markets and cities. George Kubler proposed to reassign the entire category of artifacts, ‘desirable things’ that humans make, from cultural anthropology to art history. These five twentieth-century American writers tried to redefine the concept of culture so as to make it useful for art and artists. The goal, in Kubler’s words, was to create a kind of renaissance, a ‘type of society in which excellent art inevitably and necessarily appears.’ Perhaps they lost that argument; the successes of sociological approaches to literature suggest that they did. In this seminar, we will run the test again. We will also consider some examples of social theory by Du Bois, Moynihan, Elster, Fields, and Patterson; some songs, jokes, and stories; and selections from Vico and Tocqueville, two earlier writers who would have loved the social sciences. .","prerequisites":"ENGL 067 PO","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"GEOL-192-PO-04","id":"192","code":"GEOL","dept":"PO","section":"04","title":"Senior Project in Geology","max_seats":15,"seats_taken":5,"seats_remaining":10,"credits":50,"credits_hmc":150,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["NA"],"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":"00:00:00","location":{"school":"NA","building":"","room":""}}],"instructors":["Nicole E Moore"],"notes":"By PERM only","description":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"GEOL-192-PO-08","id":"192","code":"GEOL","dept":"PO","section":"08","title":"Senior Project in Geology","max_seats":15,"seats_taken":3,"seats_remaining":12,"credits":50,"credits_hmc":150,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["NA"],"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":"00:00:00","location":{"school":"NA","building":"","room":""}}],"instructors":["Nicole E Moore"],"notes":"By PERM only.","description":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"GERM-002-PO-01","id":"002","code":"GERM","dept":"PO","section":"01","title":"Elementary German 2","max_seats":18,"seats_taken":13,"seats_remaining":5,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"start_time":"09:00:00","end_time":"09:50:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Mason Hall","room":"1"}}],"instructors":["Hans J.

Even though early precursors like Guy-Blaché, were often erased from film history, women directors in France have a long tradition to draw from. It is this tradition of women filmmaking that we will explore in this course, focusing in particular on a new generation of women directors who today are revitalizing contemporary French cinema. Directors studied include: Guy, Dulac, Epstein, Varda, Akerman, Denis, Palcy, Sciamma, Maïwenn, Benguigui, Braillat, Ducournau.

What are the philosophical assumptions and beliefs that hold their various political opinions together? What is their view of the human person and how does it shape the way they see the world? Do they each offer equally rational ways of comprehending the world? We will also investigate how deeply our nation is divided. Is it the case, for instance, that only a handful of radicals wage these wars while most Americans are actually quite moderate? Are our political divisions really rooted in separate cultures? In addition, we will ask whether the culture wars have been good or bad for American democracy.

That is the tension inherent in the essay: a global, culturally rich form in writing, photography, and film that both makes the world strange and holds it intimately close, a form that criticizes the world and also loves it. If we are conditioned by our education to think of the essay as academic, five-paragraph, caught up in the power, conventions, and privileges of the academy and belles lettres, this course explores a different way of writing, photographing, filming. Since its formal inception in the sixteenth-century the essay-associative, digressive, fragmentary; filled with the presence of the author-has been defined and redefined as everything from a stay against fascism to the “writing on the walls of the prison house of culture,” a way of resisting the deadening status quo, a “matter of life and death.” We will study the history of the essay as a form and write, photograph, draw, and film our own essays in order to understand what the essay is, how it works, and what social and political force it might, and does, have. A course in literature, film, and visual anthropology (taught by faculty from English and Anthropology), we will be thinking about the relationship between powers of resistance and modes of representation.

Bourgeois, every day, dour, realistic. Filled with very-long novels about banks and dinners. And then at the window, Frankenstein’s creature; a spectral woman in the garden; a hyena with human hands; a revenant nun; a malevolent vampire. This course examines the simmering undercurrents of fear in Victorian Britain through the supernatural beings populating its novels, poetry, short stories, and non-fiction prose. We will ask three questions: first, what is 19th-century Britain-powerful, wealthy, imperial-so afraid of, and why do those fears (of colonial uprising, of modern science, of women’s rights, of working-class insurrection, of sexual desire) take shape in literature as reanimated corpses, vampires, specters, immortal libertines, and human-animal hybrids? Second, how do the ascendant literary forms of this era try to manage that fear or, conversely, what literary innovations emerge from the failure to manage it? And finally, we will ask about the changing nature of fear itself in nineteenth-century Britain, from the cathartic fear that complements Romantic sublimity through the disciplinary fear imposed by institutional capitalism to the hysteria, anxiety, and neurosis of late century psychoanalytic thinking.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"HIST-105-PZ-01","id":"105","code":"HIST","dept":"PZ","section":"01","title":"Latinx and Pacific Islander Soci","max_seats":25,"seats_taken":13,"seats_remaining":12,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Wednesday"],"start_time":"19:00:00","end_time":"21:50:00","location":{"school":"Pitzer","building":"Avery Hall","room":"201"}}],"instructors":["Robin Garcia"],"notes":"","description":"The broader social processes of racialization and contestation are explored using the educational experiences of Asian Americans.

The arts of nourishing life are also elaborated in later Buddhist, Confucian, and Daoist literature, as well as in East Asian writings. Through close readings of selected primary sources in English translation (e.g. Mencius, Zhuangzi, Dogen’s “Instruction to the Cook,” and a Tibetan tantric meditation manual), we will analyze the different recipes proposed by East Asian thinkers for prolonging life and attaining health, and the different biological, ethical, philosophical, psychological, and at times spiritual assumptions undergirding their concepts of health and wellbeing.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"HIST-191-PO-04","id":"191","code":"HIST","dept":"PO","section":"04","title":"Senior Thesis","max_seats":20,"seats_taken":8,"seats_remaining":12,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["NA"],"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":"00:00:00","location":{"school":"NA","building":"","room":""}}],"instructors":["Angelina Yanyan Chin"],"notes":"By PERM only","description":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"HIST-191-SC-01","id":"191","code":"HIST","dept":"SC","section":"01","title":"Senior Thesis in History","max_seats":99,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":99,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["NA"],"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":"00:00:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Arranged Location","room":"ARR"}}],"instructors":["Corey Tazzara"],"notes":"","description":"Fall enrollment for a one-semester thesis, or a two-semester thesis.

This course does not focus on syntactic theory, but instead introduces students to the wide range of grammatical structures that are possible in human language. The course includes overview readings and discussions of broadly attested morphosyntactic patterns. In addition, students will research an individual (unfamiliar) language over the course of a semester (based on existing research on the language) and will present the structures of their chosen language back to the class on a regular basis in both written and oral form. In this way the class serves to introduce students to the range of morphosyntactic constructions in a broad range of the world’s languages. This course satisfies the ‘Syntax’ requirement of the Linguistics major, but it does not serve as a prerequisite for LGCS 183 Topics in Generative Syntax.

College also represents some of our greatest challenges. As individuals, we may face anxiety, self-doubt, and isolation. As a community, diverse life experiences, socioeconomic backgrounds, and beliefs may clash, with no easy solutions. We are challenged when our aspirations are unmet and our imaginations unrealized. How can colleges craft responses to foster the promise of higher education–from opportunity and social mobility to inclusion and pluralism? What more can and should be done? Through course materials, in conjunction with our own experiences and analysis, we will situate the institution of higher education within the broader context of American society, politics, and the economy. As part of our collective journey this semester, we will practice a variety of learning modalities, including student-driven discussion, informal in-class writing, formal (out-of-class) writing, and group projects. Throughout, we will practice knowledge construction as a communal process rooted in open dialog, thoughtful analysis, intellectual curiosity, and self-reflection.

Analyzing a variety of such movements in both the West and the developing world, we will explore the following questions: What social and political conditions give rise to such movements? How do social movements affect political institutions and vice-versa? What determines their success or failure? What is the impact of social movements both on public policy and on patterns of everyday interaction? In short, we will be concerned with the relationship between social movements, political institutions and public policies.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"PE-020B-PO-01","id":"020B","code":"PE","dept":"PO","section":"01","title":"Body&Strength Interval Training","max_seats":14,"seats_taken":9,"seats_remaining":5,"credits":25,"credits_hmc":75,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:05:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Rains Center","room":"PAUL"}}],"instructors":["Emmanuelle M.

In addition, the practice of mindfulness has been integrated into Western psychotherapy and evidence-based practices. This course is designed to provide a multifaceted understanding of mindfulness and meditation. We will examine historical and contemporary issues, review and practice different types of mindfulness, examine the physiological underpinnings of mindfulness, and research how mindfulness can be beneficial across a variety of domains.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"PE-034B-PO-01","id":"034B","code":"PE","dept":"PO","section":"01","title":"Dance - Intl Standard Intermed","max_seats":50,"seats_taken":12,"seats_remaining":38,"credits":25,"credits_hmc":75,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"start_time":"18:00:00","end_time":"19:00:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Smith Campus Center","room":"BLRM"}}],"instructors":["Denise Marie Machin"],"notes":"Course has prerequisites.

New forms emerged such as modern and postmodern dance, butoh, styles of professional folk dancing that first developed in Eastern Europe and classical Asian traditions that had never been presented outside of the courts in which they had developed. In addition, the 19th century saw the beginnings of Broadway musicals, and the 20th century the development of dance for the movies, and later television, which dramatically increased the demand for dance performances.

Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law?

Since the 1990s, however, more and more of these states have displayed significant weaknesses and fragility. While they retain formal control over people and territories, many face increased competition from alternative modes of social and political organizations, including “traditional” political systems, non-governmental organizations, religion-based groups, insurgencies and militias, decentralized entities, trafficking networks and internationally-sponsored trusteeship-like arrangements like quasi-permanent UN interventions. Scholars have tried to capture this increased institutional diversity with notions such as “hybrid effective governance,” “heterarchy,” “areas of limited statehood,” “oligopolies of violence,” and the like, calling attention to ongoing processes reminiscent of the birth of the nation state in competition with other forms of organization in late medieval Europe, for example.

One of the most important factors shaping the size and composition of authorized and unauthorized immigration is U.S. immigration policy. Indeed, to meet labor demands, U.S. immigration policy initially encouraged immigration from Mexico and other parts of the globe. Although labor demands continued, by the latter part of the 20th Century, some elites saw a political opportunity by constructing immigrants as a threat and the U.S. Mexico border as dangerous. A major focus of this course examines the process that has led to the criminalization of immigrants and the militarization of the U.S. Mexico border.","prerequisites":"1 Intro Soc/Behavioral","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"PSYC-133-SC-01","id":"133","code":"PSYC","dept":"SC","section":"01","title":"Positive Psychology","max_seats":14,"seats_taken":12,"seats_remaining":2,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Reopened","timing":[{"days":["Friday"],"start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"16:15:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Outdoor classroom","room":"02"}},{"days":["Friday"],"start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"16:15:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Humanities Building","room":"105"}}],"instructors":["Lahnna Catalino"],"notes":"","description":"Positive psychology is the scientific study of optimal human functioning.

Students will examine the formation of Asian American genders and sexualities alongside histories of racialization, migration, and labor that span East, South, and Southeast Asian, as well as Pacific contexts. In our engagement with transpacific movements of people and culture, we will foreground settler colonial occupations of the Pacific Islands and highlight the work of decolonial queer-feminist thinkers like Haunani-Kay Trask, Maile Arvin, and Stephanie Nohelani Teves. We will attend to the incommensurability of migrant and indigenous frameworks, even as we move through the persistence and at times concurrence of multiple forms of colonialism that connect Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. Some questions we will address include: How do historical contexts (i.e. the Cold War, 9/11, Japanese internment) affect Asian American gender formations? What does the popular (Orientalist depictions of Asian women from Geisha Girl to Tiger Mom) have to do with the geo-political (U.S. economic relations with Asia)?

Students read about and then practice various kinds of writing center pedagogy, prison writing pedagogy, and all aspects of the academic essay writing process. In doing so, they engage in nuanced discussions of the politics of academic writing, the English language, and college pedagogy; they also discuss studies of incarceration and of writing pedagogy in prisons, some of which focuses on the Inside/Out program itself. Assignments include prewriting, reflective writing, and essay-writing and revision; small-group peer workshop; full-class workshop; mock tutorial and debrief; discussion of readings; presentations; sentence-level editing; and oral presentation skill-building.","prerequisites":"Instructor permission required","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"WRIT-191-SC-01","id":"191","code":"WRIT","dept":"SC","section":"01","title":"Senior Thesis in Writing","max_seats":99,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":99,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["NA"],"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":"00:00:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Arranged Location","room":"ARR"}}],"instructors":["Staff"],"notes":"Non-SC need permission.
