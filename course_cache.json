Africana studies, while still relatively young, has a vibrant history that traces the lives and scholarship of people from African descent. Its complex and latent development in academia follows from the socio-political marginalization of people within the African diaspora. Nevertheless, resilience and perseverance will be repeated themes as we study how, through different techniques and modes of understanding, people of the African diaspora have continually challenged the western hegemony of academic study."},{"identifier":"AFRI-114-AF-01","id":"114","code":"AFRI","dept":"AF","section":"01","title":"Unruly Bodies:  Black
