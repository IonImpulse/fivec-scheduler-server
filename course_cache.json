Drawing on human geography, anthropology, and sociology, this course investigates how the uneven geographies of education express the contradictions of capitalism and white supremacy. It offers students an opportunity to critically investigate the social and political functions of formal and informal institutions of education, and to bring this wide-ranging investigation back to the politics, economics, and geographies of the Claremont Colleges, as well as to their own future spaces of education and educational labor.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":"","perm_count":0,"fee":0},{"identifier":"GWS-172-PO-01","id":"GWS","code":"172","dept":"PGWS","section":"01","title":"Race, Gender, & The Environment","max_seats":0,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":0,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"start_time":"11:00:00","end_time":"12:15:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Crookshank Hall","room":"02"}},{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"start_time":"11:00:00","end_time":"12:15:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Crookshank Hall","room":"02"}}],"instructors":["Aimee Bahng","Cherene Sherrard-Johnson"],"notes":"","description":"This course takes an intersectional approach to environmental studies, emphasizing critical feminist, queer, trans, race, and disability studies.

Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law?

Archaeology has developed its own history in relation to anthropology and needs to be contextualized within this background. The field has also developed its own distinct methods based on reconnaissance, excavation, and analysis. All archaeology is interpretive and reliant upon the methods utilized to collect data as well as upon the theoretical backgrounds, assumptions, and analyses that are applied. Archaeologists must also be concerned with a host of ethical questions that are of concern to field research in the present.

It examines why governments seem to abuse natural resources willfully, what forms of privatization hold promise for better resource use, what fiscal and governance arrangements are optimal for the relationship between government and state natural-resource agencies, and whether resource abundance is actually a \"curse\" rather than an advantage for a country's economic and political development.

Recent discoveries revealed that microorganisms are ubiquitous on Earth from the upper reaches of the atmosphere to the deep, hot subsurface. While the most familiar are found in our temperate surroundings, arguably the most fascinating microorganisms are found thriving under extreme physical and geochemical conditions where very little non-microbial life exists. In this course we will critically examine how these extremophiles adapted to survive, how their activities affect global nutrient cycles, and what their existence may tell us about the origin of life on Earth as well as the potential for life to exist elsewhere in the solar system. Finally, we will explore the impact their discovery has had on the fields of medicine and biotechnology, as well as the chemical and pharmaceutical industries.","prerequisites":"BIOL043L KS & BIOL044L KS; or BIOL040L KS & BIOL044L KS; or BIOL042L KS & BIOL044L KS; and CHEM015L KS or CHEM042L KS or CHEM029L KS","corequisites":"","offered":"","perm_count":2,"fee":0},{"identifier":"BIOL-120-KS-01","id":"BIOL","code":"120","dept":"CBIO","section":"01","title":"Research Tools:Organismal Biol","max_seats":0,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":0,"credits":0,"credits_hmc":0,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Wednesday"],"start_time":"15:45:00","end_time":"17:00:00","location":{"school":"NA","building":"Keck Science Center","room":"101"}}],"instructors":["Donald A.

The course prioritizes a decolonial or anti-imperial approach to borderlands to uncover histories of marginalized peoples who have often been exploited and oppressed related to structures of racism. Course readings focus on borderlands in the Americas in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, although comparative global examples allow students to recognize shared traits of borderlands regions or 'in-between peoples' in diverse contexts. Readings raise issues related to identities such as race, ethnicity and gender, migrations, geographies, settler-colonialism and citizenship.

Citizenship is typically thought of as state-granted universal membership in the national community with a guarantee of equality through civil, political, and social rights. However, citizenship is also a terrain of social struggle in which marginalized groups contest their exclusion. Historically, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and other non-Whites have been restricted from full and equal standing in the nation. The high growth-rate of Latino/as since the 1970s has further challenged the notion of liberal inclusion. The key issue of undocumented migration and controversies over 'illegality' further complicate the significance of Latino citizenship within the borders of the United States. This class will incorporate interdisciplinary scholarship, focusing on how Latino/as have claimed rights in the shadow of citizenship. We will draw from legal and political theory, feminist theory, and critical race theory, as well as ethnographies and case studies that surface how citizenship is enacted and embodied. By the end of the course, students will understand the origins of nation-state citizenship, the role that race, gender, class, and labor played in shaping the legal parameters of American citizenship. Students will also be able to analyze how globalization, migration, and U.S. foreign and economic policies have challenged and transformed citizenship. Finally, students will analyze the different ways that subaltern communities have redefined citizenship through in their daily lives.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":"","perm_count":0,"fee":0},{"identifier":"CHST-136-CH-01","id":"CHST","code":"136","dept":"PCHS","section":"01","title":"Latinx Social Movements","max_seats":0,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":0,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Tuesday"],"start_time":"14:45:00","end_time":"17:30:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Estella Laboratory","room":"2393"}}],"instructors":["Arely M Zimmerman"],"notes":"","description":"Latin/o/a/xs have historically used grassroots community organizing and social movement participation to press for socio-political change.

Through our iterative encounter with these and related questions, we will consider how literature compels us to revise what we know, or think we know, about the world and how it operates. It is the central argument of this class that close reading allows us to understand poetic and fictional worlds according to their discrete and unique logic; it is the political gamble of this course that close reading the worlds of fiction and poetry permits us to see 'this' world-the actual, real, or historical world-in its capacity to be otherwise. Readings will range from Isabella Whitney, George Herbert, and John Donne to Shirley Jackson, Aimee Bender, and Carmen Maria Machado. We will watch a few films (Hitchcock's Rope and Lamorisse's The Red Balloon) and we will read example of close reading from the visual arts (e.g. T.J. Clark).

Since a definition of racial identity is complicated and multifaceted, it is important to begin with an understanding that the African American poetic voice is not monolithic. In terms of a poetic tradition, however, one could argue that the history of social and political struggle (Abolitionism, Civil Rights, Black Nationalism, Black Feminism, LBGTQ rights, and Afrofuturism) established an artistic continuum. This tradition is shaped by intimacy, a desire for justice, joy, transcendence from suffering, and the simple and complicated wish to be free. We will discuss religion, visual culture, politics, dance, music, and comedy. Rather than reduce African American poetry to a timeline, we will follow the echoes of history, analyzing how voices and themes overlap.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":"","perm_count":0,"fee":0},{"identifier":"ENGL-047-PO-01","id":"ENGL","code":"047","dept":"PENG","section":"01","title":"The Literature of Gambling","max_seats":0,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":0,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:30:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Crookshank Hall","room":"207"}}],"instructors":["Sarah Raff"],"notes":"","description":"Narratives of gambling-in which the arc of a life may seem to depend on a roll of the dice-in comparative perspective, with an emphasis on various concepts for thinking about an unknown future, including fate, divine intervention, luck, hazard, chance, speculation, risk, and accident.

The class will examine how these novels both participated in and were shaped by various social, political, and cultural developments of the long nineteenth century, including(among many others) the contest to define democracy in the early republic, the explosion of writing by and for women in the 1840s and 50s, the antebellum struggles over slavery, and the rise of modern social movements. The class will also consider writing about novels-from both 19th-century writers and later scholars-giving particular attention to accounts of what distinguishes \"the American Novel\" from other national traditions, especially the English novel. It will also consider the limitations of accounts that understand the development of the novel in such national terms. In addition, this course will offer an introduction to the subfield of 20th and 21st-century literary theory known as \"theory of the novel.\" We will both consider how these theories of the genre illuminate the novels that we are reading and consider the ways in which these grand theories of the novel cannot account for the genre as it developed in the US.

We demand proof; we conduct experiments; we test everything: nuclear weapons, pregnancy, drugs, IQ, DNA, HIV and everything else. This, we think, distinguishes us from our medieval forebears. Still, what is more characteristic of the Middle Ages than their regimes of proof?--trial by ordeal; the test of a hero in a quest; demonstrations of the number of angels on the head of a pin. The purpose of this seminar is to see what-if any-difference obtains between medieval and modern experiences of verification. Keeping in mind modern and contemporary work on the experimental disposition of modernity (Nietzsche, Heidegger, Latour, Ronell), we will examine the reality probes sent out by literary, juridical, logical, theological, mystical, and scientific texts from the Middle Ages. To be considered: the failed tests of Perceval and Gawain; disputation and demonstration in the medieval university; Anselm's proof for the existence of God; torture; methods for distinguishing genuine revelation from demonic apparition; early scientific experiments; Ramon Llull's logic machines; the trial of Joan of Arc.

Student teams will start with a creative/innovative idea for a product to meet customers' unmet needs. They will develop a set of untested hypotheses and validate them quickly. They will use a business model canvas to diagram value creation for customers and validate hypotheses to create a repeatable, scalable business model. Teams will rapidly iterate their product to build something people actually want. They will build minimum viable products (MVPs) to avoid hypotheticals and get real customer feedback that they can use to iterate (small adjustments) or pivot (substantive changes) faster.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":"","perm_count":0,"fee":0},{"identifier":"EA-010-PO-01","id":"EA","code":"010","dept":"PEVA","section":"01","title":"Intro to Environmental Analysis","max_seats":0,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":0,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Reopened","timing":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:30:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"To Be Assigned","room":"TBA"}}],"instructors":["Joanna L.

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) act as the unseen infrastructures for gathering, managing, and analyzing data that is or can be mapped, that is connected to some part of the world. GIS can be applied broadly in multiple domains to create maps that guide policymakers, businesses, communities, and individuals to make important decisions. In recent years, these tools have increased in sophistication allowing us to model complex socio-spatial relationships while simplifying the processes involved with easy-to-follow drop-down menus and an increasing array of off-the-shelf plug-ins for mobile and desktop applications. Collectively these transformations have enabled an expanded user-base to enter the world of map-making. Yet, how do we ensure that these tools are (re)oriented toward the ends of creating a more ecologically and socially just world? In this course, you will develop a solid foundation on the commonly used processes for creating static and interactive maps that reflect hidden inequalities and disparities; as well as highlight hopeful imaginations of a more just world. In order to reach these aims, this course takes a student-centered approach, grounded in critical pedagogies and anti-racist frameworks. Students will work with the instructor and their peers to develop a collective model of engagement that values the contributions of all classroom participants and allows for an individualized assessment of growth in developing fluency of the complex mix of technological tools and theoretical understandings that undergird GIS.This course will provide an introduction and overview of GIS; specifically, ESRI WebGIS and ArcGIS mapping software; to demonstrate the basic analysis of spatial data for those interested in answering questions about the spatial significance of environmental justice, racial inequality, hazard exposure, and health equity.

In mapping European and American music's queer underground, we delve into provocative topics like operatic castration practices, eroticism in convent music, synthesizers and transgender embodiment, David Bowie's and Prince's gender-fluid personae, LGBTQIA+ roots of Disco and House (EDM), and more.

Starting in 1791, the enslaved broke their chains in the Haitian Revolution and radically recast the promise of freedom in the Americas. Colombia is home to the second largest Black population in Latin America after Brazil, and Blacks have stood at the heart of its struggles for dignity across the course of the nations history. Throughout the colonial era (1697 to 1791 in Haiti and the 1520s to 1810 in Colombia), the poor practiced marronage or escape from beneath the control of European slave elites and metropoles. Metaphorically, those who liberate themselves or break free are the maroon nations, the peoples who have built societies based upon egalitarianism and profound respect for the land. Ranged against them were elites closely tied to Europeans, at first, and then to the United States, up to the present. Black Colombians have won rights to the land that are historic for all people in the African Diaspora in the hemisphere. The Black majority of Haiti has, in recent decades, twice elected a president who obeys the will of the poor, and that sort of political project has encountered the full wrath of foreign soldiers, extractive economic models, and U.S.-backed coups.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":"","perm_count":0,"fee":0},{"identifier":"HIST-172-PO-01","id":"HIST","code":"172","dept":"PHST","section":"01","title":"Enlightenment and Capitalism","max_seats":0,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":0,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"start_time":"11:00:00","end_time":"12:15:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Estella Laboratory","room":"1163"}}],"instructors":["Gary Kates"],"notes":"","description":"During the eighteenth century, Enlightenment writers debated the benefits - both material and moral - of a market-driven economy and the inequality brought by commercial prosperity.

Literary Journalism has beengrouped in or alongside categories such as \"The New Journalism,\" \"Gonzo Journalism,\" \"Muckraking,\" \"Public Access,\" \"Underground,\" \"Advocacy,\" and \"Stunt\" or \"Immersion Journalism.\" It has also been viewed as a ethical conundrum, a violation of journalism's most sacred tenets, because it foregrounds the journalist's experience and uses storytelling techniques associated with fiction writing. Does the \"literary\" nature of this genre of journalism destroy \"objectivity\" and hinder the search for \"truth\"? or does it allow for a more immersive access into \"truth?\" We will pursue this question by reading the historical antecedents of literary journalism beginning in the eighteenth century and discuss its practitioners through to the present day, spending time on the genre's social justice tendencies and its gradual entry into mainstream journalism in the early-and mid-twentieth century. Students will practice various approaches to this subgenre and work to put together a Literary Journalism publication by the end of the semester. This course is an Inside-Out course. Inside-Out courses are regular college courses that are part of the international Inside-Out Prison Exchange Center model that \"bring together campus-based college students with incarcerated students for a semester-long course held in a prison.\" The Claremont Colleges Inside-Out program takes place at California Rehabilitation Center, a level II men's prison in Norco, CA.

The first half of the course will consist of an introduction to language acquisition, an introduction to Tomasello's Construction Grammar (a theory of the child acquisition of syntax), and an introduction to Chomsky's Minimalist Program (a theory of adult language syntax). The second half of the course will introduce a new theory that offers an acquisition-based explanation for some core properties of adult syntax. We will read and discuss these new proposals, consider predictions of these proposals, and students will test those predictions using already existing child language data (CHILDES). The expectation is that students will have some background in relevant issues so that everything is not entirely new, and as such a variety of prerequisites are included (with the expectation that students will have taken at least one).

Chronic daily pain affects over 50 million Americans at an estimated cost of over $600 billion annually, and it affects one in five people globally, including children. Despite intense research efforts, the basic biological mechanisms behind chronic pain - and how to effectively treat it - remain mysterious. The course will focus on the neurobiological basis of chronic pain, ranging from genetic risks to the ion channels that convey painful signals to the brain networks that underlie our experience of pain. However, chronic pain is best viewed through the lens of a biopsychosocial model, considering the biological, psychological and sociological factors that shape each individual's experience of chronic pain. In this seminar, we will examine these factors through peer-reviewed primary research papers, articles in the popular press, and guest appearances by pain researchers.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":"","perm_count":2,"fee":0},{"identifier":"NEUR-190-PO-01","id":"NEUR","code":"190","dept":"PNEU","section":"01","title":"Senior Seminar: Advanced Topics","max_seats":0,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":0,"credits":0,"credits_hmc":0,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Monday"],"start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"14:30:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Seaver Commons","room":"104"}}],"instructors":["Jonathan T.

So many students (and faculty, and staff) have experienced higher education as a place of conformity, isolation, and oppression. However, another way is possible. Liberatory educators like Paulo Friere, bell hooks, and Sara Ahmed invite us to imagine classrooms and colleges as spaces of freedom, where raucous and rebellious communities co-construct knowledge together and use it to build a more just and equitable world for all. In this course, we will engage with these scholars and ideas, add our own experiences and knowledges to what they share, and begin to construct a vision for liberatory learning at Pitzer and beyond.

However, in other traditions belief in reincarnation and karma are central beliefs and so questions regarding the nature, meaning and justification of the concepts of reincarnation and karma are important for an Eastern philosophy of religion.

The innovative method of exercise demands intense focus on certain muscle groups while all the time engaging the abdominals.

Imagination allows us to augment or even escape our mundane experiences of the actual world â via pretending, daydreaming, or our engagement with books and movies. Imagination also helps us to learn about the world in which we live. By way of imagination, we can engage empathically with others, make new discoveries, and more generally think about what could be. But what is imagination? How is it related to other mental states like belief and desire? What role does it play in our mental life? In this advanced seminar, we will consider a variety of questions about imagination in an attempt to achieve a philosophical understanding of its nature, its role in cognition, and its importance in both philosophical contexts and everyday life.
