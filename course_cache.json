Another major goal of the course is to consider the various strategies black women take up to foreground pleasure, and various ways of seeing black bodies as healthy and adequate. We can do so by examining competing versions of ‘black womanhood,’ looking at how ideas about the discourse circulate around the hegemonic idea of black women and black femininity as unruly.

We will pay particular attention to the ways that the various cultures of hip-hop and reggae critique Christianity and contemporary arrangements of power. Listening to the religio-political perspectives expressed in these cultural formations students will question whether or not the music provides a prophetic challenge to the status quo of our political and economic arrangements. Giving attention to the music, from the Negro Spirituals, to contemporary Hip Hop and Dancehall, we will contextualize it with an interest in understanding the relationship between their religious and political visions.

The subfield has developed its own extensive claims to a body of method and theory for dealing with the material remains of past human societies. ANTH 101 is designed to familiarize the student with several distinct, but inter-related aspects of archaeological method and theory. Archaeology has developed its own history in relation to anthropology and needs to be contextualized within this background. The field has also developed its own distinct methods based on reconnaissance, excavation, and analysis. All archaeology is interpretive and reliant upon the methods utilized to collect data as well as upon the theoretical backgrounds, assumptions, and analyses that are applied. Archaeologists must also be concerned with a host of ethical questions that are of concern to field research in the present. This course hopes to provide a background to understanding the uses of archaeological theory by specifically emphasizing the ways in which material culture can be utilized to make interpretations concerning both past and present behavior.

Citizenship is typically thought of as state-granted universal membership in the national community with a guarantee of equality through civil, political, and social rights. However, citizenship is also a terrain of social struggle in which marginalized groups contest their exclusion. Historically, Mexican Americans, Puerto Ricans, and other non-Whites have been restricted from full and equal standing in the nation. The high growth-rate of Latino/as since the 1970s has further challenged the notion of liberal inclusion. The key issue of undocumented migration and controversies over ‘illegality’ further complicate the significance of Latino citizenship within the borders of the United States. This class will incorporate interdisciplinary scholarship, focusing on how Latino/as have claimed rights in the shadow of citizenship. We will draw from legal and political theory, feminist theory, and critical race theory, as well as ethnographies and case studies that surface how citizenship is enacted and embodied. By the end of the course, students will understand the origins of nation-state citizenship, the role that race, gender, class, and labor played in shaping the legal parameters of American citizenship. Students will also be able to analyze how globalization, migration, and U.S. foreign and economic policies have challenged and transformed citizenship. Finally, students will analyze the different ways that subaltern communities have redefined citizenship through in their daily lives.

Part II will evaluate the formation of a pan-ethnic Latino/a identity in response to anti-immigrant politics, focusing on different regional, national, transnational and generational perspectives. By the end of the course, students will be able to articulate the structural forces, contextual factors, and power dynamics that have shaped Latinos’ struggles for full inclusion and citizenship in the US, the ways in which grassroots social activism informs new models of Latino/a electoral politics, and the contributions Latino/as have made to civil and human rights in the United States more broadly."},{"identifier":"CHST-185C-CH-01","id":"185C","code":"CHST","dept":"CH","section":"01","title":"Voices of the Tropics","max_seats":20,"seats_taken":20,"seats_remaining":0,"credits":0,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"09:35:00","end_time":"10:50:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Balch Hall","room":"218"}}],"instructors":[" Evelyn Boria-Rivera"],"notes":"SC First Years only","description":"This course offers a solid introduction to Caribbean-origin Latina literature.

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) act as the unseen infrastructures for gathering, managing, and analyzing data that is or can be mapped; guiding policymakers, businesses, communities, and individuals to make important decisions. These sophisticated tools for modeling complex socio-spatial relationships are continually simplified with easy- to-follow drop-down menus and of-the-shelf plug-ins for mobile and desktop applications, expanding the user-base of map-makers. Yet, how do we ensure that these tools are (re)oriented toward the ends of creating a more ecologically and socially just world? In this course, you will develop a solid foundation on the commonly used processes for creating static and interactive maps to reveal hidden inequalities and disparities; as well as highlight hopeful imaginations of a more just world.

Microeconomic models are used to analyze individual and household decisions regarding demographic behavior, including fertility, marriage and family organization, human capital investment (health and education), migration, and labor force behavior, as well as many factors that influence or are otherwise related to these outcomes. We will examine causes and consequences of changes in human populations (e.g., size, age structure, gender balance, health, wealth) using an economic framework. Causes and consequences of variations across time, space and subgroups in fertility, mortality, family structure, human capital investment, labor force involvement and migration will be considered, as will impacts on populations and subgroups of natural disasters, wars, pandemics, macroeconomic events, government policies, technology change, and changes in human longevity. Demographic and economic data for a wide variety of countries are used to demonstrate the interaction between economic and demographic change at the macro level. We will analyze implications for public pension systems, health systems, economic growth, the environment, inter-group conflict, and government budgets.

In a sense, as the literary theorist Catherine Gallagher has observed, novels helped create the modern idea of fictionality, acclimatizing readers for the first time to narratives that were plausible but not truthful. How, then, are we to understand recurrent attempts to produce a ‘nonfiction novel’ in the twentieth and twenty-first centuries (clustering in the 1960s and 70s, the heyday of the New Journalism, and in the 2010s, the era of ‘autofiction’)? Should this hybrid form be classified as a species of nonfiction journalism that borrows some of the formal techniques and cultural prestige of the novel, while continuing to be bound by the strictures and standards of factual reporting? Or do nonfiction novels lie closer to the heart of the novel’s tradition, given the form’s historical origins in a hazy gray area between reality and artifice, fiction and fact?

This course investigates a number of contemporary shifts in the organization of work, including the rise of neoliberalism, deindustrialization, the feminization of the paid labor force, the prevalence of precarious work, contemporary forms of labor migration, and the expansion of prison labor. Locating these shifts in the longer histories and geographies of unfree labor, students will examine some of the ways in which workers have used their labor as a departure point for collective action, including unionization, work refusals, and struggles over social reproduction."},{"identifier":"GEOG-179G-HM-01","id":"179G","code":"GEOG","dept":"HM","section":"01","title":"Political Ecologies","max_seats":24,"seats_taken":22,"seats_remaining":2,"credits":0,"status":"Reopened","timing":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"14:55:00","end_time":"16:10:00","location":{"school":"HarveyMudd","building":"Shanahan Center","room":"2465"}}],"instructors":[" David Seitz"],"notes":"","description":""},{"identifier":"GEOL-015-PO-01","id":"015","code":"GEOL","dept":"PO","section":"01","title":"SoCal Earthquakes and Water","max_seats":12,"seats_taken":13,"seats_remaining":-1,"credits":0,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"09:35:00","end_time":"10:50:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Edmunds","room":"130"}},{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"09:35:00","end_time":"10:50:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Studio Arts","room":"OUTD"}}],"instructors":[" Linda A.

Students will examine the formation of Asian American genders and sexualities alongside histories of racialization, migration, and labor that span East, South, and Southeast Asian, as well as Pacific contexts. In our engagement with transpacific movements of people and culture, we will foreground settler colonial occupations of the Pacific Islands and highlight the work of decolonial queer-feminist thinkers like Haunani-Kay Trask, Maile Arvin, and Stephanie Nohelani Teves. We will attend to the incommensurability of migrant and indigenous frameworks, even as we move through the persistence and at times concurrence of multiple forms of colonialism that connect Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. Some questions we will address include: How do historical contexts (i.e. the Cold War, 9/11, Japanese internment) affect Asian American gender formations? What does the popular (Orientalist depictions of Asian women from Geisha Girl to Tiger Mom) have to do with the geo-political (U.S. economic relations with Asia)? How might an Asian American queer politics reveal the limitations of the model minority myth? How can centering Pacific Islander onto-epistemologies decolonize notions of gender and sexuality?

From Egypt to Britain, and from Italy to Syria, correspondents shared snapshots of life stories, political gossip, advice for managing households, and condolences for the loss of loved ones. Many of these letters are deeply personal, disclosing the emotional lives of prominent social actors, and at the same time revealing priceless information about topics such as slavery, gender, religious life, and legal culture. Other letters are official government documents that provide otherwise inaccessible details about the ancient economy and government administration. Moreover, letters were understood to be gifts that enriched the lives and status of recipients. As such, they were crafted with literary artistry and often reveal the depth of ancient engagement with literature, history, and ethics. This seminar allows students to explore a select number of letter collections that are key to understanding the rich complexities of ancient life from the 2nd to 6th centuries CE."},{"identifier":"HIST-113-PO-01","id":"113","code":"HIST","dept":"PO","section":"01","title":"Medieval Spain","max_seats":20,"seats_taken":22,"seats_remaining":-2,"credits":0,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"start_time":"13:20:00","end_time":"14:35:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Pearsons Hall","room":"101"}}],"instructors":[" Kenneth B.

It resists categorization and registers different ways of thinking about the world and one's place in it; it typically blends documentary, experimental, and narrative elements into hybrid and subjective articulations. The course aims to combine theorizing the role of the \"essayistic\" and the formal analysis of the essay film, along with an informed sense of what the \"essay\" does. We explore the possible histories of the essay film and study the relationship among essays, the essayistic, and the essay film through a series of case studies. Readings include work by Virginia Woolf, James Baldwin, Susan Sontag, Michel de Montaigne, Hito Steyerl, and Theodor Adorno. Possible filmmakers include Dziga Vertov, Alexander Kluge, Chris Marker, John Akomfrah, Harun Farocki, Fernando Solanas and Octavio Getino, Agnès Varda, Pier Paolo Pasolini, and Ja'Tovia Gary.

The first half of the course will consist of an introduction to language acquisition, an introduction to Tomasello’s Construction Grammar (a theory of the child acquisition of syntax), and an introduction to Chomsky’s Minimalist Program (a theory of adult language syntax). The second half of the course will introduce a new theory that offers an acquisition-based explanation for some core properties of adult syntax. We will read and discuss these new proposals, consider predictions of these proposals, and students will test those predictions using already existing child language data (CHILDES). The expectation is that students will have some background in relevant issues so that everything is not entirely new, and as such a variety of prerequisites are included (with the expectation that students will have taken at least one). But it is unlikely that any student will have background in all the areas that the course covers. Students ought not be deterred if they don’t have exposure in some areas that the course touches on: all necessary background will be provided during the course through readings and lectures, including technical skills for using the CHILDES corpora.

The innovative method of exercise demands intense focus on certain muscle groups while all the time engaging the abdominals. This type of activity increases strength and flexibility around the spinal column as well as other major muscle groups.

The course will cover ethnic politics, broadly conceived with a particular focus on civil disobedience, protests and political violence. Related topics may include immigration, crime and the state, and urban politics. We will consider a range of questions including, how do stories influence our sense of self, community and nation? How do filmmaking techniques (e.g. cinematography, casting, sound design) influence which people and issues become salient? How do aesthetic and narrative choices affect attitudes about the social order and who is deserving of power? Through close readings of films, social science, and media studies scholarship, this course will enable students to study key political science concepts, the institution of cinema, and how stories make meaning.

In asking these questions, this course considers the challenges posed to empires by territorial states, corporations, tribal and other non-territorial forms of political organization, and tribute systems."},{"identifier":"POST-195-PZ-01","id":"195","code":"POST","dept":"PZ","section":"01","title":"Senior Seminar","max_seats":8,"seats_taken":12,"seats_remaining":-4,"credits":0,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Friday"],"start_time":"13:20:00","end_time":"16:20:00","location":{"school":"Pitzer","building":"Skandera Hall","room":"P103"}}],"instructors":[" Geoffrey Herrera"],"notes":"Pitzer Seniors in Major Only\nTheme of course, \"Technology &\nPolitics\"","description":""},{"identifier":"POST-195-PZ-02","id":"195","code":"POST","dept":"PZ","section":"02","title":"Senior Seminar","max_seats":8,"seats_taken":13,"seats_remaining":-5,"credits":0,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Wednesday"],"start_time":"15:00:00","end_time":"17:45:00","location":{"school":"Pitzer","building":"Online","room":""}}],"instructors":[" Sharon Nickel Snowiss"],"notes":"Pitzer Seniors in Major Only\nTheme of Course: \"Year 2050\nUtopia or Oblivion\"\nBeing taught remotely","description":""},{"identifier":"PPA-190-PO-01","id":"190","code":"PPA","dept":"PO","section":"01","title":"Internship and Thesis Seminar","max_seats":20,"seats_taken":14,"seats_remaining":6,"credits":0,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Friday"],"start_time":"13:20:00","end_time":"16:20:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Carnegie Building","room":"109"}}],"instructors":[" Sara Sadhwani"],"notes":"Letter grade only.\nNon-Pomona requires PERM.\nSeniors only.\nPPA majors only.","description":"Analysis of internship experience; readings on research methods, politics and ethics of research; development and design of senior thesis.

We will use scholarship, media, and case studies from across the African continent and world to explore topics such as: environment and health; the built environment and cities; energy; extractive industries; commodity chains; food systems and agriculture; soil and land; waste management; environmental degradation; capitalism and environmental violence; post-humanism, indigeneity, and resource use; transnational environmental governance; conservation; climate change and climate (in)justice; environmental imagery, imagination, and political economy; and environmental futures. In so doing, we ask: in a globalized world, how do gender, race, ethnicity, class, and colonialist legacies influence the questions raised and the solutions offered in response to African environmental issues?

In this seminar we investigate theories from writing studies to examine our own diverse experiences in writing. What does it mean to call something “good” writing? What ideological and cultural assumptions underwrite definitions? What can scholars tell us about why so many of us struggle with the writing process?

Why should or shouldn't anyone pursue the liberal arts? Why is it so hard for colleges to decide which subjects are required? What is the value of a liberal-arts education in an increasingly commodified world? What is the definition and value of diversity in the liberal arts? Are new values threatening to overshadow basic pursuits into knowledge and truth, and is this good or bad? Our examination will translate into working together towards designing, developing, shaping, and polishing clear and detailed compositions.

From the Cyclops of Homer&#8217;s Odyssey to its refiguring in D.W. Griffith&#8217;s &#8220;The Birth of a Nation,&#8221; the powers of the eye are equated with those of its celestial counterpart. This intrigue has been reshaped—but not lost—with the advent of modern visual surveillance techniques.

Yet research shows us writing is a social practice developed through regular practice, challenging new tasks, and constructive feedback. In this seminar we investigate theories from writing studies to examine our own diverse experiences in writing. What does it mean to call something &#8220;good&#8221; writing? What ideological and cultural assumptions underwrite definitions? What can scholars tell us about why so many of us struggle with the writing process? And what are some strategies we can use to help ourselves and others grow as writers? Aimed at students interested in cultivating the habits of effective writers, educators, this class is both theoretical and practical in its orientation."},{"identifier":"WRIT-100B-PZ-01","id":"100B","code":"WRIT","dept":"PZ","section":"01","title":"Writing Center Theory & Praxis","max_seats":12,"seats_taken":21,"seats_remaining":-9,"credits":0,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Friday"],"start_time":"13:20:00","end_time":"16:20:00","location":{"school":"Pitzer","building":"Avery Hall","room":"202"}}],"instructors":[" Stephanie Liu-Rojas"],"notes":"Instructor PERM required","description":""},{"identifier":"WRIT-105-SC-01","id":"105","code":"WRIT","dept":"SC","section":"01","title":"Writing and the Liberal Arts","max_seats":12,"seats_taken":11,"seats_remaining":1,"credits":0,"status":"Reopened","timing":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"start_time":"13:20:00","end_time":"14:35:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Humanities Building","room":"119"}}],"instructors":[" Glenn W.

Why should or shouldn't anyone pursue the liberal arts? Why is it so hard for colleges to decide which subjects are required? What is the value of a liberal-arts education in an increasingly commodified world? What is the definition and value of diversity in the liberal arts? Are new values threatening to overshadow basic pursuits into knowledge and truth, and is this good or bad? Our examination will translate into working together towards designing, developing, shaping, and polishing clear and detailed compositions. Assignments will likely include debates or mock trials on our main questions, analytical responses to the readings, workshops and reviews of classmates' compositions, a mission statement for a liberal-arts college, and a defense or critique of a requirement at the Claremont Colleges."},{"identifier":"WRIT-132-SC-01","id":"132","code":"WRIT","dept":"SC","section":"01","title":"Arts + Culture Review","max_seats":12,"seats_taken":20,"seats_remaining":-8,"credits":0,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"start_time":"16:30:00","end_time":"17:45:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Humanities Building","room":"105"}}],"instructors":[" Kimberly Drake"],"notes":"Instructor permission required.","description":"This course is a writing workshop designed to enhance your skills in the journalistic review.
