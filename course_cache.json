We begin by looking at how the evolution of language was tightly linked to the evolution of bipedalism in our Homo lineage. Students will gain an understanding of how language evolved in conjunction with human locomotion and will read recent research on human dispersals and how language diversified as people moved around the globe. After studying this picture of linguistic diversity, we then ask why it is that so many similarities remain between languages separated by great distances. What do these similarities, called language universals, reveal about human cognition? Turning subsequently to modern migrations, we interrogate what might be learned about the nature of globalization by looking at how people are using language today. If globalization is often described as the dissolution of the nation-state in favor of global forces like “the market” and transnational organizations, how might speech practices attest to the continued relevance of the local in the construction of human identity? Examples from many different contexts will be contrasted in order to better understand the varying outcomes that result when language communities come into contact (e.g., language shift/maintenance/endangerment, diglossia, dialect leveling, code-switching), and also the identity dynamics and power relations at hand in each of these situations.

Archaeology has developed its own history in relation to anthropology and needs to be contextualized within this background. The field has also developed its own distinct methods based on reconnaissance, excavation, and analysis. All archaeology is interpretive and reliant upon the methods utilized to collect data as well as upon the theoretical backgrounds, assumptions, and analyses that are applied. Archaeologists must also be concerned with a host of ethical questions that are of concern to field research in the present.

Beginning in the eighteenth century, as major scientific developments were unfolding in Europe and the United States, these regions were engaging in colonial expansion in Africa, Asia and the Americas. These two processes were often linked. Colonial aims influenced medico-scientific paradigms, and emergent scientific knowledge shaped how colonizers governed and controlled populations. This course examines these intertwined historical processes and how they laid the foundations for medico-scientific research and practice today. Drawing on anthropological and historical texts, we examine key themes such as scientific racism, hygiene and morality, and the regulation of indigenous knowledges. Throughout, we engage with concepts of the postcolonial and the settler colonial to help us understand the complexity of connections between past and present.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"ANTH-115-SC-01","id":"115","code":"ANTH","dept":"SC","section":"01","title":"Stuff:Social Life of Commodities","max_seats":10,"seats_taken":13,"seats_remaining":-3,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"14:45:00","end_time":"16:00:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Humanities Building","room":"104"}},{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"14:45:00","end_time":"16:00:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Outdoor classroom","room":"01"}}],"instructors":["SeoYoung Park"],"notes":"Instructor permission required.","description":"The world is becoming overstuffed by stuff.

New forms emerged such as modern and postmodern dance, butoh, styles of professional folk dancing that first developed in Eastern Europe and classical Asian traditions that had never been presented outside of the courts in which they had developed. In addition, the 19th century saw the beginnings of Broadway musicals, and the 20th century the development of dance for the movies, and later television, which dramatically increased the demand for dance performances. The course will look at the ways these various professional dance genres have developed and the role they play in the concert scene today.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"DANC-139-PO-01","id":"139","code":"DANC","dept":"PO","section":"01","title":"Dance, Ethnicity, Nationalism","max_seats":12,"seats_taken":12,"seats_remaining":0,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"09:35:00","end_time":"10:50:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Pendleton Dance Studio","room":"CLAS"}}],"instructors":["Anthony Shay"],"notes":"","description":"In the United States, and generally in Western Europe, most individuals think of dance in three ways: 1. A social activity such as a school dance or dancing in a club, 2. A form of entertainment as in a Broadway or Hollywood musical or a television program like “Dancing with the Stars,” or 3. A form of artistic production like Giselle or choreography by Martha Graham. In this class we will look at dance in a different way. We will look at dance as a vehicle for achieving political goals, for representing the state, for building ethnic identities, for demonstrating national pride. We will first conceptualize the idea of dance as a political vehicle and then we will look at specific examples: Irish step dancing, Ukrainian and Russian folk dancing, the Hawaiian hula, the Argentine tango and Turkish folk dancing, among others, all of which have served regimes of various political stripes.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"DANC-142-SC-01","id":"142","code":"DANC","dept":"SC","section":"01","title":"Feminist Ethnography & Perf","max_seats":20,"seats_taken":10,"seats_remaining":10,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"start_time":"16:30:00","end_time":"18:00:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Vita Nova Hall","room":"100"}}],"instructors":["Meiver De la Cruz"],"notes":"1st-yrs need permission.","description":"This course explores transnational feminist epistemologies alongside performance studies research methods.

The course focuses on feminist research concerns and methodologies of women of color.

Yet the social, political, and environmental processes that determine who gets to live where, and what the conditions are in those places provide insights into the drivers for global health disparities. By examining how race, identity, and place operate in the US and Brazil, we can better understand the social processes that create disparities in health. Further, focusing on informal settlements, places that are thought to embody these disparities (areas often referred to as slums, shantytown, favelas), helps to highlight these complex interrelated themes of place, health and identity. This course is designed to provide a broad investigation of urban health equity while focusing on the key role that identity formation and place-making have in both creating health disparities and community responses to ameliorate those disparities. In this course, students will engage with theoretical and practical tools that serve to unmask local and global health disparities. Particularly, students will learn to conduct their analysis using Atlas.ti, a Qualitative Data Analysis (QDA) software.

He is struck by the scene; he makes a note of it: “she walks at her own pace, unaware of the fact that her son’s rhythm is different.” A year later, the scene inspires the first of his final lecture courses, which he called “How to Live Together: Novelistic Simulations of Some Everyday Spaces.” At the heart of the course was Barthes’ concept of idiorrhythmy, a monastic term, the idea of “individual rhythms” that exist-nonetheless-in and with a sense of community. To explore this idea, he turned to literature. This course will do that also. We will take up Barthes’ notion of idiorrhythmy and expand it into broader interdisciplinary theories of the commons: “spaces, experiences, resources, memories, or forms of sharing and living.” How does literature, we will ask, offer us ways to think about common spaces and experiences, about individual rhythms and efforts (and their failure) to bring those rhythms into community? Literature is also a commons: we’ll consider literary form, aesthetics, and poetics even as we look to literary representation, to “content.” Our literary focus will be literature in Britain from roughly 1700-1900, the period in which the Enclosure Acts took enormous common swaths of land and privatized them, the period in which rampant colonial ambitions, rising industrial capitalism, and rapid urbanization altered permanently the global landscape of common spaces and resources. Our theoretical reading, however, will range far more broadly: work on the commons moves across economics, politics, ecology and biology, aesthetics, philosophy, sociology, and, of course, literary and cultural theory. Literary authors may include: Daniel Defoe, Oliver Goldsmith, Mary Shelley, Margaret Cavendish, Olaudah Equiano, Christina Rossetti, Mary Wollstonecraft, Percy Shelley, William Wordsworth, Charlotte Smith, John Ruskin, E.M.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"ENGL-030-PZ-01","id":"030","code":"ENGL","dept":"PZ","section":"01","title":"Introduction to Creative Writing","max_seats":16,"seats_taken":16,"seats_remaining":0,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"11:00:00","end_time":"12:15:00","location":{"school":"Pitzer","building":"Robert Redford Conservcy","room":"B105"}}],"instructors":["Felicia Luna Lemus"],"notes":"First-Years & Sophomores Only.

Yet, some contend, artistic creation has never been the pure expression of individual genius, nor has the reception of art ever been immune to the influences of ideology. If artists are not independent self-knowers, but rather products of socially constructed effects of power, to what extent do they have control over their work? If objective certainty is a myth, how do we judge good art from bad? If the cult of the ‘genius’ is a product of patriarchy, how do we conceive of creative expression? How do forms of new media influence consciousness and political action?

Whatever their similarities, however, such views harbor important (and arguably fundamental) differences, including in the sorts of normative arguments they rely on; in their conceptions of and attitudes toward law and of the state; in the political role they assign to public justification and deliberation; and in various specific policy prescriptions. This course takes a comparative, critical look at several important statements of classical liberal and libertarian positions by philosophers and social theorists, and at the ways in which these theorists sometimes distance themselves from one another. In some semesters, the course will also consider left-libertarian views that fuse a commitment to self-ownership with egalitarian commitments.

We will study this history not in isolation, but within the context of the Atlantic world, and the turbulent flows of peoples, goods, and ideas within it.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"FHS-010-CM-10","id":"010","code":"FHS","dept":"CM","section":"10","title":"Freshman Humanities Seminar - Individual, Community, & Culture","max_seats":18,"seats_taken":19,"seats_remaining":-1,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday","Friday"],"start_time":"09:00:00","end_time":"09:50:00","location":{"school":"ClaremontMckenna","building":"The Kravis Center","room":"166"}}],"instructors":["Robert Valenza"],"notes":"CMC students only.

Cicero’s life spanned a period of intense political, social, and intellectual change that would inevitably lead to the rise of autocratic emperors. Sometimes a participant, and always an acute observer of affairs in Rome, Cicero provides us with a remarkably detailed picture of an ancient society in evolution. This course will follow, and question the nature of, the end of the Roman Republic through a close inspection of Cicero’s political speeches and court cases, letters to friends (and enemies), and moral and philosophical treatises.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"FHS-010-CM-04","id":"010","code":"FHS","dept":"CM","section":"04","title":"Freshman Humanities Seminar - Islam and the West","max_seats":18,"seats_taken":15,"seats_remaining":3,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Reopened","timing":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"11:00:00","end_time":"12:15:00","location":{"school":"ClaremontMckenna","building":"Roberts South","room":"104"}}],"instructors":["Gary Hamburg"],"notes":"CMC students only.

What can art tell us about the social sciences? Ralph Ellison worried that sociology would reduce songs, jokes, and stories to culture, and reduce persons to data; his friend Albert Murray simply called sociology ‘the folklore of white supremacy.’ Hannah Arendt assigned artworks the important task of maintaining a space between individual persons to prevent their collapse into a mass of social stuff. Jane Jacobs believed that economists and city planners fundamentally misunderstood the aesthetic nature of markets and cities. George Kubler proposed to reassign the entire category of artifacts, ‘desirable things’ that humans make, from cultural anthropology to art history. These five twentieth-century American writers tried to redefine the concept of culture so as to make it useful for art and artists. The goal, in Kubler’s words, was to create a kind of renaissance, a ‘type of society in which excellent art inevitably and necessarily appears.’ Perhaps they lost that argument; the successes of sociological approaches to literature suggest that they did. In this seminar, we will run the test again. We will also consider some examples of social theory by Du Bois, Moynihan, Elster, Fields, and Patterson; some songs, jokes, and stories; and selections from Vico and Tocqueville, two earlier writers who would have loved the social sciences. .","prerequisites":"ENGL 067 PO","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"GEOL-192-PO-04","id":"192","code":"GEOL","dept":"PO","section":"04","title":"Senior Project in Geology","max_seats":15,"seats_taken":5,"seats_remaining":10,"credits":50,"credits_hmc":150,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["NA"],"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":"00:00:00","location":{"school":"NA","building":"","room":""}}],"instructors":["Nicole E Moore"],"notes":"By PERM only","description":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"GEOL-192-PO-08","id":"192","code":"GEOL","dept":"PO","section":"08","title":"Senior Project in Geology","max_seats":15,"seats_taken":3,"seats_remaining":12,"credits":50,"credits_hmc":150,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["NA"],"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":"00:00:00","location":{"school":"NA","building":"","room":""}}],"instructors":["Nicole E Moore"],"notes":"By PERM only.","description":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"GERM-002-PO-01","id":"002","code":"GERM","dept":"PO","section":"01","title":"Elementary German 2","max_seats":18,"seats_taken":13,"seats_remaining":5,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"start_time":"09:00:00","end_time":"09:50:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Mason Hall","room":"1"}}],"instructors":["Hans J.

It examines why governments seem to abuse natural resources willfully, what forms of privatization hold promise for better resource use, what fiscal and governance arrangements are optimal for the relationship between government and state natural-resource agencies, and whether resource abundance is actually a “curse” rather than an advantage for a country’s economic and political development.

What are the philosophical assumptions and beliefs that hold their various political opinions together? What is their view of the human person and how does it shape the way they see the world? Do they each offer equally rational ways of comprehending the world? We will also investigate how deeply our nation is divided. Is it the case, for instance, that only a handful of radicals wage these wars while most Americans are actually quite moderate? Are our political divisions really rooted in separate cultures? In addition, we will ask whether the culture wars have been good or bad for American democracy.

This course examines the simmering undercurrents of fear in Victorian Britain through the supernatural beings populating its novels, poetry, short stories, and non-fiction prose. We will ask three questions: first, what is 19th-century Britain-powerful, wealthy, imperial-so afraid of, and why do those fears (of colonial uprising, of modern science, of women’s rights, of working-class insurrection, of sexual desire) take shape in literature as reanimated corpses, vampires, specters, immortal libertines, and human-animal hybrids? Second, how do the ascendant literary forms of this era try to manage that fear or, conversely, what literary innovations emerge from the failure to manage it? And finally, we will ask about the changing nature of fear itself in nineteenth-century Britain, from the cathartic fear that complements Romantic sublimity through the disciplinary fear imposed by institutional capitalism to the hysteria, anxiety, and neurosis of late century psychoanalytic thinking.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"HIST-105-PZ-01","id":"105","code":"HIST","dept":"PZ","section":"01","title":"Latinx and Pacific Islander Soci","max_seats":25,"seats_taken":14,"seats_remaining":11,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Wednesday"],"start_time":"19:00:00","end_time":"21:50:00","location":{"school":"Pitzer","building":"Avery Hall","room":"201"}}],"instructors":["Robin Garcia"],"notes":"","description":"The broader social processes of racialization and contestation are explored using the educational experiences of Asian Americans.

The arts of nourishing life are also elaborated in later Buddhist, Confucian, and Daoist literature, as well as in East Asian writings. Through close readings of selected primary sources in English translation (e.g. Mencius, Zhuangzi, Dogen’s “Instruction to the Cook,” and a Tibetan tantric meditation manual), we will analyze the different recipes proposed by East Asian thinkers for prolonging life and attaining health, and the different biological, ethical, philosophical, psychological, and at times spiritual assumptions undergirding their concepts of health and wellbeing.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"HIST-191-PO-04","id":"191","code":"HIST","dept":"PO","section":"04","title":"Senior Thesis","max_seats":20,"seats_taken":8,"seats_remaining":12,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["NA"],"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":"00:00:00","location":{"school":"NA","building":"","room":""}}],"instructors":["Angelina Yanyan Chin"],"notes":"By PERM only","description":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"HIST-191-SC-01","id":"191","code":"HIST","dept":"SC","section":"01","title":"Senior Thesis in History","max_seats":99,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":99,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["NA"],"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":"00:00:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Arranged Location","room":"ARR"}}],"instructors":["Corey Tazzara"],"notes":"","description":"Crisis and Revolutions provides a foundational knowledge of World History and its methods.

We begin by looking at how the evolution of language was tightly linked to the evolution of bipedalism in our Homo lineage. Students will gain an understanding of how language evolved in conjunction with human locomotion and will read recent research on human dispersals and how language diversified as people moved around the globe. After studying this picture of linguistic diversity, we then ask why it is that so many similarities remain between languages separated by great distances. What do these similarities, called language universals, reveal about human cognition? Turning subsequently to modern migrations, we interrogate what might be learned about the nature of globalization by looking at how people are using language today. If globalization is often described as the dissolution of the nation-state in favor of global forces like “the market” and transnational organizations, how might speech practices attest to the continued relevance of the local in the construction of human identity? Examples from many different contexts will be contrasted in order to better understand the varying outcomes that result when language communities come into contact (e.g., language shift/maintenance/endangerment, diglossia, dialect leveling, code-switching), and also the identity dynamics and power relations at hand in each of these situations. The course has a speaking-intensive overlay and uses films alongside readings to explore each unit’s key topics.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"LGCS-123-PO-01","id":"123","code":"LGCS","dept":"PO","section":"01","title":"Stats and Experimental Design","max_seats":15,"seats_taken":9,"seats_remaining":6,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Monday","Wednesday"],"start_time":"14:45:00","end_time":"16:00:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Lincoln","room":"1125"}}],"instructors":["Laura Wendy Johnson"],"notes":"Letter grade only.

Ralph Ellison worried that sociology would reduce songs, jokes, and stories to culture, and reduce persons to data; his friend Albert Murray simply called sociology ‘the folklore of white supremacy.’ Hannah Arendt assigned artworks the important task of maintaining a space between individual persons to prevent their collapse into a mass of social stuff. Jane Jacobs believed that economists and city planners fundamentally misunderstood the aesthetic nature of markets and cities. George Kubler proposed to reassign the entire category of artifacts, ‘desirable things’ that humans make, from cultural anthropology to art history. These five twentieth-century American writers tried to redefine the concept of culture so as to make it useful for art and artists. The goal, in Kubler’s words, was to create a kind of renaissance, a ‘type of society in which excellent art inevitably and necessarily appears.’ Perhaps they lost that argument; the successes of sociological approaches to literature suggest that they did. In this seminar, we will run the test again. We will also consider some examples of social theory by Du Bois, Moynihan, Elster, Fields, and Patterson; some songs, jokes, and stories; and selections from Vico and Tocqueville, two earlier writers who would have loved the social sciences. .","prerequisites":"ENGL 067 PO","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"MATH-052-JT-01","id":"052","code":"MATH","dept":"JT","section":"01","title":"Introduction to Statistics","max_seats":49,"seats_taken":53,"seats_remaining":-4,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"08:10:00","end_time":"09:25:00","location":{"school":"Pitzer","building":"Avery Hall","room":"201"}}],"instructors":["Jemma Margaret Lorenat","Christina J.

This especially applies to the one empirical topography most closely associated with the studio system - the city of Los Angeles.

New forms emerged such as modern and postmodern dance, butoh, styles of professional folk dancing that first developed in Eastern Europe and classical Asian traditions that had never been presented outside of the courts in which they had developed. In addition, the 19th century saw the beginnings of Broadway musicals, and the 20th century the development of dance for the movies, and later television, which dramatically increased the demand for dance performances. The course will look at the ways these various professional dance genres have developed and the role they play in the concert scene today.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"PE-039-JP-01","id":"039","code":"PE","dept":"JP","section":"01","title":"SCUBA-Beg/Int","max_seats":45,"seats_taken":12,"seats_remaining":33,"credits":0,"credits_hmc":0,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Tuesday"],"start_time":"19:00:00","end_time":"22:00:00","location":{"school":"ClaremontMckenna","building":"Off-Campus Crs Facility","room":""}}],"instructors":["Rusty Berry"],"notes":"Fee:$495 + pers snrkl eqp ($400).

Through close readings of the poems of these major American poets, students will open an inquiry into how friendship, in addition to artistic and temperamental differences, can influence and shape style.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"PE-039E-JP-01","id":"039E","code":"PE","dept":"JP","section":"01","title":"SCUBA-Lvl 3 Advanced Open Water","max_seats":35,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":35,"credits":0,"credits_hmc":0,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Thursday"],"start_time":"18:00:00","end_time":"20:00:00","location":{"school":"ClaremontMckenna","building":"Off-Campus Crs Facility","room":""}}],"instructors":["Rusty Berry"],"notes":"Fee:$495 + pers snrkl eqp ($400).

This practical bend is reflected in the Anabasis, describing his adventures in Persia, and the Education of Cyrus, an account of how to conquer the world that earned Machiavelli’s approval. Yet Xenophon also wrote the Memorabilia, a work devoted to a consideration of Socrates and his more contemplative way of life.

How do border changes, nation-state formation, and the collapse and rise of empires trigger ethnic cleansing and genocide as occurred in the Ottoman Empire, the Second World War, and more recently in the post-Soviet conflicts in the former Yugoslavia? Lectures and discussions will delve into specific topics, such as the role of racism, anti-Semitism and biopolitics, the psychological responses of victims, the inclusion of rape as a genocidal war crime, the response of bystanders, perpetrator motivation, and trends in post-genocidal societies such as trials, memorialization and compensation.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"PE-094-PO-01","id":"094","code":"PE","dept":"PO","section":"01","title":"Mental Skills/Exerc.

Law is often understood to derive its legitimacy from its opposition to violence. And yet, paradoxically, the enforcement of law is inseparably bound to acts of state violence, both threatened and enacted. What role has law played in organized movements to suppress race-based violence? How have appeals to law supplied tools of recourse, resistance, political struggle, and freedom? Alternatively, when and how might law create, sustain, or institutionalize violence against people of color? What roles do gender and sexuality play in negotiating the boundaries of violence and law? Drawing principally from African American political thought, this course considers the relationship between violence and law in three historical contexts: slavery and abolition, segregation and civil rights, and the rise of mass incarceration.","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"POLI-146-SC-01","id":"146","code":"POLI","dept":"SC","section":"01","title":"Slow Theory: Wayward Lives,","max_seats":12,"seats_taken":14,"seats_remaining":-2,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Closed","timing":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"11:00:00","end_time":"12:15:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Outdoor classroom","room":"03"}},{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"11:00:00","end_time":"12:15:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Baxter Hall","room":"108"}}],"instructors":["Mark Golub"],"notes":"","description":"This course will expose the students to the basic tools of critical film analysis, and to different styles of filmmaking in the world.

Since the 1990s, however, more and more of these states have displayed significant weaknesses and fragility. While they retain formal control over people and territories, many face increased competition from alternative modes of social and political organizations, including “traditional” political systems, non-governmental organizations, religion-based groups, insurgencies and militias, decentralized entities, trafficking networks and internationally-sponsored trusteeship-like arrangements like quasi-permanent UN interventions. Scholars have tried to capture this increased institutional diversity with notions such as “hybrid effective governance,” “heterarchy,” “areas of limited statehood,” “oligopolies of violence,” and the like, calling attention to ongoing processes reminiscent of the birth of the nation state in competition with other forms of organization in late medieval Europe, for example.

However, the century-long positive perceptions gave way to a more negative and hostile view of the US in the Middle East since the mid-20th century. To understand this radical shift in the relations between the US and the Middle East (including Pakistan and Afghanistan), we will study and discuss events, ideas, and doctrines that have shaped the interactions between these countries since the mid-19th century. Along the way, we will examine key issues such as America’s earliest cultural and educational engagement in the region, Cold War rivalries, oil, US military intervention in the region since the 1950s and its support of authoritarian governments, Arab Nationalisms, the 1979 Iranian Revolution, and the rise of Islamist Movements.

We will attend to the incommensurability of migrant and indigenous frameworks, even as we move through the persistence and at times concurrence of multiple forms of colonialism that connect Asia, Oceania, and the Americas. Some questions we will address include: How do historical contexts (i.e. the Cold War, 9/11, Japanese internment) affect Asian American gender formations? What does the popular (Orientalist depictions of Asian women from Geisha Girl to Tiger Mom) have to do with the geo-political (U.S. economic relations with Asia)? How might an Asian American queer politics reveal the limitations of the model minority myth? How can centering Pacific Islander onto-epistemologies decolonize notions of gender and sexuality?","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"SPAN-191-PO-04","id":"191","code":"SPAN","dept":"PO","section":"04","title":"Senior Thesis","max_seats":15,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":15,"credits":50,"credits_hmc":150,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["NA"],"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":"00:00:00","location":{"school":"NA","building":"","room":""}}],"instructors":["Jose Reynaldo Cartagena"],"notes":"By PERM only","description":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"SPAN-191-PO-08","id":"191","code":"SPAN","dept":"PO","section":"08","title":"Senior Thesis","max_seats":15,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":15,"credits":50,"credits_hmc":150,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["NA"],"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":"00:00:00","location":{"school":"NA","building":"","room":""}}],"instructors":["Suzanne Chavez Silverman"],"notes":"By PERM only","description":"","prerequisites":"","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"SPAN-191-SC-01","id":"191","code":"SPAN","dept":"SC","section":"01","title":"Senior Thesis in Spanish","max_seats":99,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":99,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["NA"],"start_time":"00:00:00","end_time":"00:00:00","location":{"school":"Scripps","building":"Arranged Location","room":""}}],"instructors":["Staff"],"notes":"Non-SC need permission.

Ralph Ellison worried that sociology would reduce songs, jokes, and stories to culture, and reduce persons to data; his friend Albert Murray simply called sociology ‘the folklore of white supremacy.’ Hannah Arendt assigned artworks the important task of maintaining a space between individual persons to prevent their collapse into a mass of social stuff. Jane Jacobs believed that economists and city planners fundamentally misunderstood the aesthetic nature of markets and cities. George Kubler proposed to reassign the entire category of artifacts, ‘desirable things’ that humans make, from cultural anthropology to art history. These five twentieth-century American writers tried to redefine the concept of culture so as to make it useful for art and artists. The goal, in Kubler’s words, was to create a kind of renaissance, a ‘type of society in which excellent art inevitably and necessarily appears.’ Perhaps they lost that argument; the successes of sociological approaches to literature suggest that they did. In this seminar, we will run the test again. We will also consider some examples of social theory by Du Bois, Moynihan, Elster, Fields, and Patterson; some songs, jokes, and stories; and selections from Vico and Tocqueville, two earlier writers who would have loved the social sciences. .","prerequisites":"ENGL 067 PO","corequisites":"","offered":""},{"identifier":"THEA-062-PO-01","id":"062","code":"THEA","dept":"PO","section":"01","title":"Lifting Silent Narratives","max_seats":12,"seats_taken":0,"seats_remaining":12,"credits":100,"credits_hmc":300,"status":"Open","timing":[{"days":["Tuesday","Thursday"],"start_time":"13:15:00","end_time":"15:45:00","location":{"school":"Pomona","building":"Seaver Theatre","room":"120"}}],"instructors":["Rose M.

The course will attend to such issues as the emergence of modern social movements, the explosion of writing by and for women, and the popularity of gothic and sensational fiction in the penny press. Readings will encompass both \"classic\" American literature and the ephemera of antebellum print culture.
